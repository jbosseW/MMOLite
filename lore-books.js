    content: 'I have spent fourteen years piecing together references to\na group the pre-war elvish sources call the Vel\'sharath.\nImperial records translate this as "The Void Covenant" or\n"The Hollow Circle," but I have consulted three independent\nscholars of Old Elvish, and all agree the literal meaning\nis closer to "Those Who Seek the Light" or perhaps "Those\nWho Call Toward Radiance."\n\nThe discrepancy is troubling. Why would the empire\nmistranslate a name so fundamentally?\n\nThey were not, as imperial doctrine insists, summoners of\nvoid entities or practitioners of nihilist philosophy.\nTheir surviving writings reveal something unexpected:\nresearchers. Systematic, methodical, and deeply devout.\n\nThe Vel\'sharath conducted what they called "resonance\nstudies," attempts to measure the presence of divine\npower in the world. Their methodology was rigorous.\nThey catalogued prayer response rates across seventeen\ntemples over a period of two centuries. They mapped\nfluctuations in divine healing efficacy. They measured\nthe dimming of sacred sites.\n\nTheir central finding, repeated across hundreds of\nindependent observations:\n\n    "The resonance fades. Where once the divine\n    answered, now there is silence. The temples\n    still stand. The prayers still rise. But\n    nothing answers. Nothing has answered for\n    a very long time."\n\nThe implications are staggering. If their data was\naccurate, the Vel\'sharath were not heretics conjuring\ndarkness. They were scientists documenting an absence\nso vast that acknowledging it would reshape theology\nacross the known world.\n\nI must consider the possibility that the empire had\nreasons beyond public safety to destroy these records.\n\nI have discontinued my research. Not because of what\nI found, but because of who has begun asking about\nmy work.\n\n                    - Final entry, undated'

He\nsays the silence from the heavens has gone on too long.\nOur prayers rise and rise and nothing answers. We must\nseek the gods directly. We must reach them.\n\nDay 34:\nCael\'vorith\'s expedition into the deep ruins beneath\nMount Ilvareth has returned. They found something\nextraordinary: buried in a sealed chamber older than\nany elven construction, an artifact of clearly divine\norigin. A focusing instrument, small, barely the size\nof a wagon wheel, but when tested it amplifies spiritual\nresonance a thousandfold. We call it the Lesser Lens. It is not of mortal make. The materials, the geometry,\nthe resonance patterns are beyond anything we can\nreproduce. We believe it was left here. By whom, and\nfor what purpose, we intend to discover.\n\nDay 89:\nFirst activation of the Lesser Lens. We aimed it upward,\ntoward the heavens, and spoke the Reaching Prayer. The\nresonance was extraordinary, like singing into a\ncathedral and hearing the echo of every voice that ever\nsang there before you.\n\nBut no answer came. Only echoes. Ancient echoes. The\nresidue of prayers answered long, long ago. This was\nour first terrible confirmation: the silence is not\nindifference. It is ABSENCE. The gods are not listening\nbecause the gods are not there.\n\nDay 142:\nWe have redirected the Lens. If the gods are not above,\nperhaps they are elsewhere. We are mapping the spiritual\ntopology of creation itself, searching for any trace,\nany thread that might lead us to where they went.\n\nDay 203:\nCael\'vorith wept today. Through the Lens, he found\nsomething. Not the gods. Something else. Something\nBENEATH the Holy City. A presence, divine in nature\nbut chained. Diminished. Being slowly drained.\n\nHe says it is Helios.\n\nNot a god. A demi-god. Imprisoned beneath the earth.\nHis power siphoned to fuel an empire that claims his\nblessing.\n\nThe prayers of a billion souls, rising toward a being\nwho cannot answer because he is in chains.\n\nDay 204:\nIf this is true, everything changes. Everything the\nempire has built is founded on a lie. Helios does not\nrule from heaven. He suffers beneath the Holy City.\n\nWe must find the true gods. We must bring them back.\nOnly they can set this right.\n\nDay 211:\nThe empire knows we are here. Cael\'vorith says it does\nnot matter. Our work is nearly complete. The Lens has\nfound traces. Faint paths leading outward, beyond the\nedges of the world. The gods did not die. They LEFT.\n\nBut why?\n\nI pray we find the answer before the empire finds us.\n\n                    - No further entries'

Our orders said\nwe were containing a "void incursion." We were told the\nelves had opened a gate to nothingness itself. That reality\nwould unravel if we did not act.\n\nI believed it. Every man in the Fourteenth believed it.\n\nWe marched in expecting monsters. Demons. The end of the\nworld.\n\nWhat I saw was a circle of elves in white robes, kneeling\naround a device that looked like a lens or a mirror, aimed\nat the sky. They were praying. Not chanting in some dark\ntongue. PRAYING. Hands raised upward. Tears on their\nfaces. Some of them were singing. It was the most beautiful\nsound I have ever heard.\n\nThey were reaching UPWARD, not downward.\n\nI reported this to Captain Vasek. He told me to keep my\nmouth shut. The orders were already given. Heaven\'s Atlas\nwas being prepared.

Seven thrones carved from\nlight itself, arranged in a circle above the world.\nEvery throne was empty. Dust lay upon seats that had\nnot been occupied for ages beyond counting.\n\nThe gods did not fall. They did not die.\nThey DEPARTED. Willingly. As if called away.\nAs if something greater than godhood summoned them.\n\nTHE SECOND SEEING: THE PRISONER BENEATH.\n\nI looked downward, toward the roots of the Holy City,\nand saw a figure chained in golden light. A being of\nfire and radiance, diminished, flickering, barely\nalive. Helios. Not a god enthroned in heaven but a\ndemi-god imprisoned in earth. Tubes of crystallized\nprayer ran from his body into the foundations of the\nCathedral above. His power drained. His voice silenced.\nHis suffering used to light an empire that worships\nhis name while feeding on his flesh.\n\nHe opened his eyes. He saw me seeing him.\n\nThe grief in those eyes will never leave me.\n\nTHE THIRD SEEING: THE ATLAS.\n\nI saw Heaven\'s Atlas as it truly is. Not a weapon\nbuilt by mortal hands. A divine instrument, shaped by\nthe gods themselves before their departure. A\ncartographer\'s tool for mapping the architecture of\nreality: space, time, the boundaries between worlds.\nIn the hands of the gods, it was a lens for\nunderstanding creation.\n\nIn the hands of mortals, it is a cannon aimed at the\nworld.\n\nTHE WARNING:\n\nThose who seek the truth will be destroyed by those\nwho profit from the lie.

    content: 'I AM SELENDRIEL, ONCE CALLED THE WISE.\n\nI write this confession in stone, for paper burns and\nmemory fades, and what I have to say must endure longer\nthan empires.\n\nI knew the Vel\'sharath. I studied alongside Cael\'vorith\nin the years before he founded the order. I read his\nearly research: the prayer-response studies, the\nresonance measurements, the mapping of divine absence.\n\nI knew they were right.\n\nThe evidence was overwhelming. Prayers unanswered for\ncenturies. Sacred sites dimming year by year. Healing\nmagic growing weaker with each generation. The gods\nwere gone. They had been gone for longer than anyone\nwanted to admit. And Helios, poor, broken Helios,\nwas not a god sitting in judgment. He was a prisoner\nsitting in chains.\n\nI knew the Vel\'sharath were seeking the gods, not\nsummoning the void. I knew their Lesser Lens was a\nprayer amplifier, not a weapon. I knew their research\nwas the most important theological discovery in the\nhistory of the world.\n\nI said nothing.\n\nI told myself it was prudence. That the empire would\nlisten to reason. That the truth would emerge on its\nown. That it was not my place to risk everything for\nscholars who had already risked everything themselves.\n\nThe truth: I was afraid.\n\nWhen the sky turned white over Calidar, I was three\nhundred miles away. I felt the ground shake. I saw the\nlight on the horizon. And I knew, before the reports\ncame, before the refugee columns formed, before the\nempire declared its glorious victory over the "Void\nCovenant," I knew that an entire civilization had\nbeen murdered to protect a lie I had been too cowardly\nto challenge.\n\nFive hundred years of silence. Five hundred years of\nwatching the empire tell the world that the Vel\'sharath\nwere nihilists, void-worshippers, reality-enders. Five\nhundred years of hearing the story repeated until even\nelves began to believe it.\n\nI knew they were seeking the gods, not summoning the\nvoid. I said nothing.\n\nThe empire destroyed Calidar to bury the truth about\nHelios. To protect its claim to divine mandate. To\nensure no one ever learned that Heaven\'s Atlas is a\nstolen god-tool and the entire theological foundation\nof human civilization is built on the suffering of a\nchained demi-god.\n\nAnd every day I choose silence again. Because speaking\nnow would mean admitting I could have spoken then. And\nif I had spoken then, perhaps Calidar would still\nstand. Perhaps my people would still have a home.\n\nTo whoever reads this after I am gone:\n\nThe Vel\'sharath were not what the empire says they\nwere. They were the bravest of us. They sought the\ngods when everyone else accepted the silence.\n\nFind what they were looking for.\nThe gods are missing.\nSomeone should be looking for them still.\n\n                    - Selendriel the Sorrowful\n                      Last of the Witnesses\n                      Year 500 After the Burning'

    content: 'To understand the Dominion is to understand Helios, the Unconquered Sun, whose light guided humanity from scattered tribes to the greatest civilization the world has known.\n\nIn the centuries before the Last World War, humanity was fractured — dozens of petty kingdoms squabbling over the central plains while the elder races hoarded knowledge and territory. The rise of Helios worship, consolidating from one of several sun cults into the dominant spiritual framework, gave humanity its first unified identity. Where the elves had arcane mastery and the orcs had military tradition, humans found in the Doctrine of the Chosen a purpose that transcended tribal boundaries.\n\nThe Last World War tested that purpose to its limit. For five hundred years, human soldiers fought and died on every front. When Heaven\'s Atlas ended the war in a single decisive stroke, the Doctrine was vindicated in the most terrible way possible: humanity survived because it was willing to use the weapon no one else had built.\n\nThe five centuries since Year 0 have been a story of consolidation. The Holy Dominion extended its administration across the central plains and into the territories of races too diminished by the war to resist. The Luminary Inquest was established to ensure that the magical weaponization that had nearly destroyed the world could never recur. The Cathedral District grew into the spiritual heart of an empire that spans a continent.\n\nCritics may question the Dominion\'s methods. The documented renewal system, the Inquest\'s enforcement authority, the integration of non-human populations into imperial administrative structures — these are the necessary costs of maintaining order in a world that nearly destroyed itself. The alternative is the chaos that preceded the war: a world where every race with sufficient magical power could threaten its neighbors with annihilation.\n\nThe Dominion exists because someone must hold the center. Helios chose humanity for this purpose. History has confirmed His wisdom.'

    content: 'The Last World War began, as most continental conflicts do, with a territorial dispute. In the fifth century before Year Zero, the expanding Holy Dominion collided with the Orcish Khanate over control of the western grasslands. What should have been a border conflict escalated when the elven nation of Calidar, seeking to protect its southern trade routes, intervened with magical support for the Khanate.\n\nWithin a generation, every major power on the continent had been drawn in. The dwarven holds sealed their gates and declared neutrality — a neutrality they maintained by mining and selling weapons-grade materials to every side simultaneously. The gnomish archipelago contributed siege constructs of devastating mechanical precision. The goblin warrens, caught between the major powers, fragmented into guerrilla cells that would outlast the war itself by eight centuries.\n\nThe war\'s middle period saw the industrialization of magical warfare. Plague sorcery. Siege constructs powered by crystallized mana. The weaponization of ley-line intersections. Each escalation produced a counter-escalation. The elves developed ward networks that could protect entire cities. The humans developed siege magic that could crack those wards. The orcs, under the Great Khan, unified forty-seven clans into the most effective combined-arms military force the world had ever seen.\n\nThe Great Khan died in Year minus-forty-five, and the Khanate fragmented. The war continued for another forty-five years without its most dangerous participant, growing more brutal as the remaining powers fought with increasing desperation.\n\nHeaven\'s Atlas was deployed in Year Zero. The weapon — its origins still classified five centuries later — detonated above the elven homeland of Calidar. The forests vitrified. The rivers boiled. Between eighty and ninety percent of the elven population perished in a single afternoon.\n\nThe war ended. The silence that followed was not peace. It was the absence of anyone willing to continue fighting.\n\n[REDACTED: Sections on Atlas development, deployment authorization chain, and post-deployment assessment have been removed per Inquest Directive 7-C.

The event forced the Dominion\'s hand. What had been a sealed secret became a contained public emergency. The Rift Compact of Year 480 brought six races together for the first time since the war, formally recognizing the Guild\'s authority over Rift zones and granting Guild towns extraterritorial status.\n\nThe Guild itself was built on organizational principles borrowed from the Veiled Hand — the compartmentalized intelligence network that had been operating since Year 1. Where the Veiled Hand worked in shadows, the Guild would work in daylight. Where the Hand\'s mission was anti-escalation through targeted removal, the Guild\'s mission was containment through documentation.\n\nTen anchor towns were established as operational bases, spanning the continent from the Holy Dominion to Clockwork Harbor. A rank system was created — Stone through Relic — that gave every member, regardless of race, identical institutional standing. This was, and remains, the only structure in the world where racial equality is encoded in charter rather than aspiration.\n\nThe Guild\'s first Warden, a human named Cael Duskwalker, descended into the Rift on the charter\'s signing day and returned with the first documented floor map. He described "a space that builds itself around you, that tests what you bring and responds with what you lack. The things inside it are not alive in any way I recognize. They move. They fight. They wear familiar faces. But when you look into their eyes, nothing looks back."\n\nHe served for thirty years and retired with full honors. He never spoke publicly of what he saw on the deeper floors. He left one sealed document for the archive, marked not to be opened for a century. We are, as of this writing in Year 495, still five years from that date.'

The geological feature located within the Cathedral District\'s southeastern boundary — catalogued in Survey Report CD-75-001 as "a gap in the ground that goes further than it should, emitting periodically a temperature differential inconsistent with local geology" — has been growing.\n\nI have accessed the original Year 75 survey through standard archival channels. The feature described in that report measured approximately three meters in diameter at its visible surface expression. The feature I observed during my visit to the Cathedral District in Year 249 measures approximately twelve meters. The growth rate, assuming linear progression, is approximately five centimeters per year.\n\nMore concerning than the physical expansion is the qualitative change in the anomaly\'s behavior. The Year 75 survey describes temperature differentials and unusual acoustics. The feature I observed produces intermittent visual distortions — brief moments where the space within the gap appears to contain structures, textures, and light sources that have no correspondence to the geological substrate.\n\nI am naming this feature the Rift, for clarity in future documentation.\n\nI recommend a comprehensive multi-disciplinary survey involving representatives from at least three racial scholarly traditions.

Each clan had its own law, its own traditions, its own grievances with every neighbor. The Khan spent twelve years traveling between them, not with an army but with a legal framework. He proposed a code that honored every clan\'s sovereignty while creating a unified command structure for the war that everyone could see was coming. He did not ask the clans to surrender their identity. He asked them to add a layer of cooperation above it. Twelve years. Forty-seven clans. One code. No military force used against any clan that eventually joined. That is what the empire suppressed in Year 400 — not a military gathering, but a legal assembly trying to finish what the Khan started."\n\nElder Kashara, Clan of the Storm:\n"People remember the battles. The siege of Thornhold. The crossing of the Ashblood River. The flanking maneuver at Calidar\'s southern approach that broke the elven ward line for the first time in three hundred years. These are remembered because they are spectacular. What is not remembered is the Khan\'s camp. Every evening, he held court. Every soldier could speak. Every grievance was heard. He ate the same rations, slept on the same ground, wore the same leather. When he wrote his succession clause, he wrote it in the field, by firelight, while his officers debated the next day\'s march. He never finished it. Whether that was deliberate — whether the Khan chose to leave the question of succession open because he believed no single successor could hold the code together — is something I have spent three hundred years considering. I do not have an answer."\n\nElder Vasska, Clan of the Deep Root:\n"The Khan died in campaign. The cause was a seizure — I was there, I held his arm while the healers worked. The empire\'s historians say he was assassinated. The Veiled Hand\'s involvement has been speculated about for eight centuries. I will say only this: the Khan had been having seizures for months. The healers knew. The Khan knew. He refused to stop writing the code because he believed he could finish it before his body finished him. He was wrong by seventeen words. The succession clause ends mid-sentence. Seventeen words from completion. I have counted."'

    content: 'Welcome to the Administration. You have been selected for archival duties based on your aptitude scores, your lineage assessment, and the recommendation of your training supervisor. This primer will orient you to the fundamental principles of elven record-keeping.\n\nPrinciple One: Nothing is destroyed. Every document that enters the archive remains in the archive. Documents may be reclassified, relocated, or restricted — but never destroyed. The empire destroys documents. We do not. This distinction is the foundation of everything that follows.\n\nPrinciple Two: Cross-reference everything. A document filed under a single category is a document that can be hidden by reclassifying that category. A document filed under seventeen categories is a document that would require seventeen simultaneous reclassifications to hide — a logistical impossibility in any bureaucracy, including ours. File thoroughly.\n\nPrinciple Three: Precision is not optional. The difference between "relocated" and "removed" is the difference between a document that can be found and a document that has been disappeared. Use exact language. Record exact dates. Note exact quantities. The empire operates on approximation. We operate on precision. This is our advantage.\n\nPrinciple Four: The archive serves memory, not power. You will be asked to file documents that benefit the empire. You will file them correctly. You will also be asked to classify documents in ways that conceal information the empire finds inconvenient. You will classify them as instructed — and you will also file them correctly under their actual categories, in the sections of the archive that the Inquest does not audit because they believe those sections contain only agricultural census data from Year 200.\n\nPrinciple Five: Remember Calidar. Everything we do — every cross-reference, every precise notation, every document preserved against the empire\'s preference — exists because a civilization can be destroyed in an afternoon but its records, if kept correctly, survive forever. You are not a bureaucrat. You are a keeper of memory. Act accordingly.'

    content: 'For the benefit of surface traders conducting business at authorized contact points, this document describes the organizational principles of the Free Holds of Stone.\n\nThe Holds are not a nation. They are a federation of autonomous labor communes, each governed by its own guild assembly. There is no king, no council, no central authority. Decisions affecting multiple holds are resolved through inter-hold negotiation conducted by elected trade liaisons — of which I am one, which is why I am writing this instead of someone more eloquent.\n\nThe fundamental principle is simple: labor belongs to those who give it, and stone belongs to those who work it. A dwarf who mines ore owns that ore. A dwarf who forges that ore into a blade owns that blade. No lord, no tax collector, no imperial administrator takes a percentage. The guild assembly sets quality standards and mediates disputes, but it does not levy taxes because the concept of taxation — the idea that someone who did not do the work is entitled to a portion of its product — is incompatible with dwarven law.\n\nThe empire has been trying to establish a formal presence at the mountain approach for twenty years. We have not responded. This is not rudeness. It is policy. The holds do not negotiate with entities that claim authority over labor they did not perform. The empire\'s Doctrine of the Chosen asserts that humans are the rightful administrators of all races. The holds\' position is that anyone who believes they have the right to administer a dwarf\'s labor has never met a dwarf.\n\nTrade is conducted at designated surface contact points, on our schedule, at prices we set. Payment is in materials or finished goods — the holds have no use for imperial coinage. If you are reading this at a contact point, welcome. Conduct your business fairly, and you will find us reliable partners. Attempt to haggle below the posted price, and you will find the contact point closed when you return.\n\nStone endures.

I am not certain I know what Phase Three entails.

Three caravans were stopped, searched, and delayed long enough to miss their trading windows.\n\nRuling: Route 7 is to be reclassified as secondary.

It has been preserved despite repeated Inquest attempts to destroy all copies.\n\nThe magic ban, enacted in Year 1, was never about safety. It was about control.\n\nThe stated justification — that the weaponization of magic during the Last World War necessitated a comprehensive prohibition to prevent recurrence — is logically incoherent. The weapon that ended the war, Heaven\'s Atlas, was not a conventional magical artifact. It operated on principles that predate the magical traditions the ban targets. Banning hedge wizards and village healers does nothing to prevent Atlas-scale events.\n\nWhat the ban does accomplish is the systematic suppression of the one capability that might allow non-human races to resist imperial authority. Elven ward magic, dwarven runecrafting, orcish battle-chanting, gnomish technomancy — each of these traditions gave its practitioners leverage that raw military force could not easily overcome. The ban did not prevent magical warfare. It prevented magical self-defense.\n\nThe cost is measured in what no longer exists. Healing traditions that sustained rural communities for millennia — banned. Agricultural enchantments that prevented famine in marginal farmland — banned. Communication networks that connected dispersed populations — banned. Weather-reading practices that saved fishing vessels — banned. The magic ban is not a surgical prohibition. It is a cultural amputation.\n\nEight hundred years of enforcement have not eliminated magic. They have driven it underground, where it operates without regulation, without training standards, without the institutional knowledge that prevents magical accidents. The Shadow Fen Commune exists because the ban created a population of practitioners who had nowhere legal to exist. The infernal pacts that power the Veil exist because the ban left desperate people with no legitimate options.\n\nThe Inquest knows this. The moderate faction within the Inquest has been arguing since Year 300 that enforcement scope has exceeded the original mandate. They are correct, and they are ignored, because the ban was never about safety. It was always about ensuring that when the empire issues an order, no one has the power to say no.'

It is a contractual exchange of energy between a mortal practitioner and an entity that exists in a space adjacent to the material world — a space that is not the Rift, not the Subterranean Seas, and not any location that conventional geography can map.\n\nThe entities — we call them Sponsors — do not have bodies, do not have names in any language mortals speak, and do not communicate in words. They communicate in pressure — a felt sense of what they want, what they will accept, and what the exchange rate is. A skilled negotiator can parse these pressures into something resembling terms.\n\nThe Commune\'s founding pact, negotiated in Year 20 by three practitioners working in concert, established the Veil in exchange for a tithe of ambient magical energy gathered from the swamp\'s ley-line intersection. This is not blood sacrifice. This is not soul trading. It is a utility bill — the Sponsors receive a continuous flow of energy from a natural source, and in return, they maintain a field that makes the Commune invisible to imperial scrying, resistant to military incursion, and geographically confusing to anyone who enters without authorization.\n\nThe cost of maintaining this arrangement is maintenance. The ley-line intersection must be monitored. The energy flow must be balanced. The pact must be renewed every seven years, which requires the negotiators to enter a trance state and renegotiate terms with entities whose concept of "fair" does not map onto any mortal ethical framework.\n\nThe empire knows the pacts are real. They prefer not to acknowledge what that implies — that the magic ban is unenforceable against practitioners who have access to power sources the Inquest cannot detect, cannot regulate, and cannot shut down. The Commune exists in the space between what the empire can do and what the empire is willing to admit it cannot.'

    content: 'COLLECTIVE INTERNAL — DISTRIBUTION: PRODUCTION COUNCIL MEMBERS ONLY\n\nThe weapon designated Heaven\'s Atlas by the Holy Dominion was not built by human hands.\n\nThis assessment is based on three hundred and sixty-seven years of analysis conducted by the Collective\'s Survey Network, cross-referenced with data obtained through intelligence-sharing agreements with the lizardfolk Astronomy Sect and independently verified by the Elven Administration\'s sealed archives.\n\nThe Atlas was found. The circumstances of its discovery remain classified at the highest level of imperial secrecy, but the physical evidence is conclusive: the weapon\'s construction materials include alloys that do not correspond to any metallurgical tradition practiced by the eight known races. Its energy architecture operates on principles that predate the magical framework the Dominion\'s scholars developed to understand it. Its activation mechanism responded to human intent but was not designed for human operators.\n\nThe Collective\'s assessment: Heaven\'s Atlas is a Predecessor artifact. It was built by the civilization that existed before the current races, the same civilization that built the binding stones at what is now the Pact Stones site, the same civilization that first contained the wound that became the Rift.\n\nThe implications are significant. The Predecessors built a weapon capable of continental-scale destruction. They built it while managing the wound. They built it and — given the weapon\'s preservation state — never used it. The Atlas was stored, not deployed. Whatever the Predecessors were preparing for, they considered a weapon of this magnitude necessary but insufficient.\n\nThe Dominion found the Atlas and used it to win a war. The Predecessors built the Atlas and chose not to use it.\n\nThis distinction is the reason Phase Three was updated.\n\nThe weapon\'s current location is unknown. Survey Station 3 has been monitoring for its energetic signature since Year 480 without detection. If the Atlas has been destroyed, the risk is manageable. If it has been hidden, the risk is moderate. If it is being shielded — if someone possesses the Atlas and has the capability to mask it from our instruments — the risk is existential.\n\nThe Collective does not speculate. The Collective prepares.'

Twelve years of documentation checks, twelve years of processing renewals, twelve years of watching the system operate from the inside.\n\nI no longer believe what I was taught.\n\nYear 826, Seventh Month:\nA goblin family was detained at the eastern checkpoint today. Their papers were current — I checked them myself, twice, because the checkpoint commander insisted they must be forged. They were not forged. They were processed through the standard elven administrative channels and bore all correct seals and signatures.\n\nThe commander confiscated them anyway. The family was held for eight hours while the papers were "verified." The verification consisted of the commander leaving the papers on his desk while he ate lunch, conducted two unrelated inspections, and wrote a letter to his wife. When he returned, he pronounced the papers "satisfactory" and released the family.\n\nThey missed their scheduled renewal appointment. They are now technically in violation of documentation law.\n\nYear 828, First Month:\nI filed a formal complaint about the eastern checkpoint through proper channels. The complaint was acknowledged. No action was taken. The checkpoint commander received a commendation for "thoroughness in documentation enforcement."\n\nYear 830, Eleventh Month:\nI have been reassigned to the northern outpost. The official reason is "rotation for professional development." The actual reason is that I asked questions in a meeting about why the Yr\'shalos Adjacent files were closed without resolution.\n\nThe north is cold. The assignment is punishment. I am writing this in a diary because diaries are personal effects and not subject to Inquest document review.\n\nI spent thirty years in the Inquest reviewing the files. I know what the Doctrine actually is. It is not divine mandate. It is institutional convenience dressed in theology.'

But it is not our forest, and the trees here do not sing the way Calidar\'s trees sang, and the rivers here carry water that tastes of stone instead of starlight.\n\nWe are told this is integration. We are told this is the empire\'s generosity — that they have given us land, that they have allowed us to maintain our archival traditions, that they have offered us a role in the administration. What they have offered us is the role of clerk in the system that processes our own imprisonment. I file the documents. I cross-reference the categories. I make the system work because the system requires my precision and because if I do not make it work, someone less precise will make it work less carefully, and the errors will cost lives.\n\nI miss the smell of Calidar after rain.\n\nLetter 7 (Year 47):\nI have been offered a senior position in the archival division. I will accept it. Not because I believe in the empire\'s mission — I never have and never will — but because a senior archivist has access to classification authority, and classification authority is the ability to determine which documents are stored where.\n\nI have begun filing certain documents under categories the Inquest does not audit.\n\nLetter 23 (Year 200):\nTwo hundred years. I have served this system for two hundred years. My children serve it. Their children serve it. We are four generations deep in an empire that destroyed our homeland and offered us paperwork as compensation.\n\nBut I have built something. Seventeen cross-references for every document the Inquest wants buried. A network of archivists who file with the same precision I taught them. An archive within the archive — a shadow system that preserves everything the empire wants forgotten.\n\nCalidar is gone. Its trees are glass. Its rivers are dust. But its records survive. Every record. Every name. Every document. Filed correctly, cross-referenced thoroughly, preserved against every attempt to erase what was done.\n\nPrecision is not a talent. It is what you do when you have enough time to notice every error you have ever made. I have had two hundred years. I have noticed them all.'

I was there when he wrote the legal code that forty-seven clans accepted as their common framework. I was there when he died.\n\nThe humans remember the Khan as a conqueror. Their historians write about his military campaigns as though war was all he was. This is what happens when a race with an eighty-year lifespan tries to understand someone who built something that was meant to last for millennia. They see the battles because battles are dramatic. They miss the law because law is patient.\n\nThe Khan\'s code was not a military document. It was a constitutional framework. It defined the relationship between clans — how territory was shared, how disputes were resolved, how resources were allocated during peace and during war. It was the most sophisticated legal instrument any orcish scholar had produced, and it was written by a man who could barely read because he dictated it to scribes while riding between encampments.\n\nThe succession clause was the code\'s final section. It was meant to describe how power transfers from one Khan to the next — not through blood inheritance, which the Khan considered barbaric, but through a process of clan consensus that would ensure the next leader had the same breadth of support the Khan himself had built.\n\nHe never finished it. Seventeen words from completion. I know because I was his scribe that night. I was holding the pen he had just set down when the seizure took him.\n\nThe empire calls us uncivilized. The empire, which produced a weapon that turned a continent to glass, calls us uncivilized. The Khan, who unified forty-seven feuding clans through law rather than conquest, is remembered in their histories as a barbarian warlord.\n\nI am three hundred and twelve. I remember everything. I remember the sound of his voice when he dictated the succession clause by firelight. I remember the exact words he said before the seizure: "The next Khan must be chosen by all clans meeting together, with equal voice given to—"\n\nSeventeen words. Three hundred and twelve years.

Ironhold timber is the densest; Sylvaris wood is the most flexible. Both command premium prices at NPC shops.\n\nSTONE: Abundant in mountain and cave zones. Essential for construction and crafting. The dwarven holds produce the finest stone, but they don\'t sell it — you\'ll need to mine your own.\n\nIRON ORE: Primary metal resource. Found in cave entrances and mountain zones. Requires smelting into iron bars before most crafting uses. A forge station is required for smelting.\n\nGLASS SAND: Found along coastlines and in desert zones. Refined into glass at a furnace, then into glass lenses and vials at a crafting table. Glass vials are essential for potion-making.\n\nMANA CRYSTAL: Rare resource found deep in dungeon chests and occasionally at ley-line intersections. Required for portal construction and high-tier enchanting recipes. The Adventure Guild pays well for mana crystals.\n\nFISH & SHELLFISH: Gathered from water zones. Fishing skill improves yield and unlocks rare catches. Cooked fish is the most efficient healing food available without alchemy.\n\nHERBS & MUSHROOMS: Found in forest and swamp zones. Essential for cooking and potion-making. Mushrooms from the Shadowfen region have unusual properties that the magic ban technically prohibits but that the Inquest has never successfully classified.\n\nGENERAL ADVICE: Gather everything. Even common resources have value at NPC shops, and supply/demand pricing means that resources currently in short supply can fetch excellent prices. Check the shop price boards regularly — a drought event can triple herb prices overnight.'

Requires a camp cooking station. Restores significant HP and provides a temporary defense bonus for the next floor. The defense bonus stacks with card effects.\n\nBREAD: Two wheat, one camp cooking station. Simple but effective — bread provides sustained HP regeneration that lasts through combat. Less dramatic than stew but more reliable.\n\nMUSHROOM BROTH: Three mushrooms, one glass vial, one camp cooking station. Provides temporary night vision equivalent to the Darkvision racial trait. Essential for non-darkvision races attempting deep floors where the Dense Fog modifier occurs.\n\nHERB POULTICE: Two herbs, one glass vial. Not technically food — applied externally. Provides a heal-over-time effect and removes one instance of the Poisoned status effect. Cheaper than a full health potion.\n\nPROPER PREPARATION: Before descending into the Rift, ensure you have: at minimum five cooked fish, one stack of bread, materials for two stews, and one mushroom broth. The difference between a successful deep dive and a death-teleport to town is usually whether you had food when the boss floor hit.\n\nA NOTE ON CAMP SAFETY: The Rift\'s camp system allows temporary rest sites on certain floors. Placing a camp triggers a chance of ambush. Always post a watch. Always cook first, eat second, sleep third. And always — always — keep your weapon within arm\'s reach. The Rift does not respect meal times.'

    content: 'A technical overview for adventurers interested in constructing personal portals, as approved by the Adventure Guild\'s Artificer Division.\n\nPORTAL BASICS: A portal is a stabilized spatial connection between two fixed points. Unlike the Rift — which generates spaces that did not previously exist — a portal connects locations that already exist in normal space. The distinction is important: portals do not create. They connect.\n\nREQUIREMENTS: Portal construction requires Crafting skill level 20, five mana crystals, ten stone blocks, five iron bars, and three cut gems. The mana crystals provide the spatial energy. The stone provides the anchor frame. The iron provides structural reinforcement. The gems provide the focusing lens that stabilizes the connection.\n\nPLACEMENT: Portals must be placed on claimed plots. The anchor stones in town Portal Nexus sites are maintained by the Guild and provide free inter-town teleportation. Personal portals connect to the Portal Nexus network and allow instant travel from your home to any anchor town.\n\nCOOLDOWN: All portal travel incurs a thirty-second cooldown. This is not a mechanical limitation — it is a biological one. Spatial translation places stress on the traveler\'s physiology. Traveling again before the cooldown expires risks spatial displacement, which is a polite way of saying "your left arm arrives before your right arm."\n\nTHEORY: The spatial energy contained in mana crystals is, according to the gnomish Survey Network\'s analysis, residual energy from the same source that powers the Rift. The key difference is scale and stability: a portal uses a fraction of the energy the Rift consumes, channeled through a focusing lens that prevents the spatial connection from expanding or shifting. The Rift, by contrast, is an uncontrolled spatial connection with no focusing mechanism and no upper limit on energy throughput.\n\nIn summary: portals are the Rift\'s principle, tamed by engineering. The Guild does not officially acknowledge this relationship, but every artificer who has built a portal recognizes the family resemblance.'

There is no\ndeception in this. There is no politics.\n\nThis is why we work stone. This is why stone is truth.\n\nA dwarf who understands stone understands themselves.\nYour hands are tools. Your labor is purpose.

We do\nnot build for glory, though the halls endure. We carve\nbecause the hold needs corridors. We build because the\nhold needs chambers. Need is the only honest patron.\n\nThe surface peoples carve statues of their kings. They\nbuild monuments to individual ambition. We find this\nbewildering. A corridor that carries water to the lower\nchambers is more worthy than a thousand statues. It\nserves. It functions. It contributes.\n\nAsk not: "What does this honor?"\nAsk instead: "What does this DO?"\n\nON IDENTITY:\n\nYou emerged from the sacred chambers as all dwarves do -\nwithout parents, without lineage, without inheritance.\nYou are a child of the stone, equal to every other dwarf\nwho has ever drawn breath in these holds.\n\nYour identity is not your name. Your identity is the\nwork you do. The mine shaft you maintain. The wall you\nreinforce. The beam you set true. When the hold endures\nanother century, that endurance is your legacy. Not yours\nalone - shared with every dwarf who labored beside you.\n\nThere is no higher honor than shared labor.\nThere is no deeper shame than idleness.\n\nThe stone waits.

    content: 'THE IRONBOUND CODE\nAs spoken by the Great Khan. As recorded by the\nlaw-keepers. As upheld by all who ride under the sky.\n\nARTICLE THE FIRST: On Law Itself\n\nThe law binds ALL. The Khan is not above it. The\nwar-chief is not above it. The rider is not above\nit. The cook, the child, the prisoner - all stand\nequal before the code. A Khan who breaks his own\nlaw is no Khan. He is a tyrant, and tyrants are\nput down like lame horses. Swiftly. Without regret.\n\nARTICLE THE THIRD: On Theft\n\nWhat belongs to the clan belongs to ALL the clan.\nTo steal from your own is to steal from yourself.\nBeyond dishonor; madness. The\nthief shall restore double what was taken through\nlabor for the clan. If they refuse, they ride alone.\nTo ride alone is to die alone.\n\nARTICLE THE SEVENTH: On Obedience in War\n\nWhen the horn sounds, there is no debate. There\nis no negotiation. There is no "I think we should."\nThere is the command and there is obedience. A rider\nwho questions orders during battle costs lives. Not\ntheir life. OTHERS\' lives. This is unforgivable.\n\nIn peace, question freely. Argue. Challenge. The\nKhan welcomes strong counsel. But when swords are\ndrawn, you are a hand on the blade, not a mind\nbehind the hilt. The mind is the Khan\'s. The hand\nis yours. Together, we cut.\n\nARTICLE THE TWELFTH: On the Treatment of the Conquered\n\nThose who submit are taken into the clan. Their\nchildren are our children. Their skills are our\nskills. They ride with us, eat with us, fight\nbeside us. Within one generation, there is no\ndifference between the conquered and the conqueror.\n\nThose who resist are broken. Utterly. So that their\nneighbors see and choose submission. This is not\ncruelty. This is mercy measured in lives saved by\nbattles not fought.\n\nThe humans call us savage for this. The humans who\ndestroyed Calidar. The humans who burn goblin children\nin sealed warrens. Let them call us what they will.\nOur conquered peoples LIVE. Theirs do not.\n\nARTICLE THE NINETEENTH: On Unity\n\nThe clans ride as one or not at all. Separation is\nweakness. The empire knows this. The empire works to\nkeep us scattered, to break apart any gathering that\ngrows too numerous, to assassinate any leader who\nspeaks of riding together again.\n\nLet the clans remember: they fear us APART. Imagine\nwhat they would feel if we rode together once more.\n\nThe code endures. The Khan is gone. But the code\ndoes not require a Khan to be true. It requires\nonly orcs who remember what we were.\n\nAnd we remember.\n\n        - Transcribed at Kragmor\n          By the law-keepers who served beneath him\n          "The sky watches. The road remembers.\n           The ancestors judge."'

They forget what we are."\n\nHe raised the Ironbound Standard and every horn on\nthe steppe answered.\n\nRiders:\nTHE HORNS ANSWERED. WE RODE.\n\nWar-singer:\nSeventeen clans. Forty thousand riders.

We did not stop for forts.\nForts do not chase.\n\nThe humans sent their Fourteenth Legion. Full armor.\nHeavy cavalry. Supply wagons stretching back twenty\nmiles. They moved like a mountain. We moved like wind.\n\nWe feigned retreat on the third day. Their general\nsmiled. "The savages run," he told his officers. His\nofficers told their men.

The Fourteenth Legion died on a field they\nnever should have entered, chasing an enemy who was\nnever running.\n\nRiders:\nTHE FIELD REMEMBERS. THE ANCESTORS WATCHED.\n\nWar-singer:\nBut the empire does not send one legion. It sends\nten. It sends twenty. It has bodies to waste and gold\nto burn. The Khan knew this. "We do not fight their\nwar," he said. "We show them the cost of fighting ours."\n\nWe burned their supply lines for eight hundred miles.\nWe took their horses. We freed their prisoners. We\nrode through their empire like a blade through cloth,\nand when they gathered enough force to stop us, we\nwere already gone.\n\nRiders:\nWE WERE ALREADY GONE. WE ARE ALWAYS GONE.\n\nWar-singer:\nThe Khan is dead now. Forty-five winters past. But\nthe riders who rode beside him still live. Our blood\nruns long. Three hundred years, four hundred, five.\nWe remember his face. We remember his voice. We\nremember the sound of forty thousand horses moving\nas one body across the grass.\n\nThe empire prays we forget. The empire works to keep\nus apart. They break our gatherings. They patrol our\nroutes. They fear what we were.\n\nLet them fear.\n\nThe code endures.

That would give us something to\nfight back against. Instead, they SCATTER us.\n\nWhen Clan Ashwind grew to four hundred riders, an\nimperial "trade delegation" arrived. Smiling. Polite.\nThey suggested we would find better grazing in the\nwestern valleys. They said it casually, the way you\nsuggest a change of weather. But behind the delegation\nwas the Eighth Legion, camped two days\' ride east.\n\nWe moved.\n\nWhen three clans gathered for the summer council at\nRedstone Ford - as we have gathered for a thousand\nyears - imperial cavalry arrived within the week.\n"Routine patrol," they said. They stayed until the\ncouncil dispersed. They counted our horses. They\ncounted our weapons. They counted our CHILDREN.\n\nWe dispersed.\n\nWhen young Garak of Clan Ironhoof began speaking of\nunity - of riding together again, of honoring the\nKhan\'s memory - he was found dead in his tent. An\narrow through the throat. Imperial fletching. The\ngarrison commander expressed "deep concern" about\n"bandit activity" and offered to "increase patrols\nfor our protection."\n\nWe buried Garak. We said nothing.\n\nThis is the empire\'s strategy. Not conquest. Not war.\nPREVENTION. They know what we are. They know what we\nbecome when we unite.

PURPOSE\n\nThe Model 7-K Industrial Frame is designated for heavy\nlabor applications including: mining extraction, structural\nconstruction, cargo transport, and hazardous material\nhandling. Its primary function is the elimination of\nbiological risk in labor categories with fatality rates\nexceeding 0.3% per annum.\n\n2. DESIGN PHILOSOPHY\n\n2.1 The Model 7-K is not a replacement for citizens.\n    It is a replacement for DANGER. No gnome should risk\n    death performing labor that a construct can perform\n    with equivalent efficiency.\n\n2.2 The 7-K frame is intentionally non-humanoid. Council\n    directive 441-B prohibits automaton designs that\n    replicate citizen appearance. Automatons serve the\n    collective. They are not the collective.\n\n2.3 Articulation points: 12 (4 primary limbs, 2 auxiliary\n    graspers, 6 stabilization anchors). Maximum load\n    capacity: 2,400 kg. Operational duration between\n    maintenance cycles: 720 hours.\n\n3. POWER SOURCE\n\n3.1 Core: Thermal-crystalline array (Class 4).\n3.2 Fuel: Geothermal ambient draw (primary), stored\n    crystal reserve (secondary, 48-hour emergency).\n3.3 NOTE: Outsiders have speculated that automaton\n    power sources are "necromantic" or "soul-bound."\n    This is incorrect. The thermal-crystalline array\n    converts ambient heat energy through a catalyzed\n    mineral lattice. There is no biological component.\n\n    (Council note: The outsider perception that our\n    automatons are "metal liches" is strategically\n    useful. Fear reinforces border security. Do not\n    correct this misconception publicly.)\n\n4. BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS\n\n4.1 The 7-K operates on directive sets, not independent\n    cognition. It follows programmed task sequences.\n    It does not think. It does not feel. It does not\n    "want" anything.\n\n4.2 Anomalous behavior reports (Incident Log 7-K-2291\n    through 7-K-2347) have been reviewed. All reported\n    instances of "independent action" were traced to\n    directive conflicts in task sequencing. No evidence\n    of emergent cognition was found.\n\n4.3 (RESTRICTED ADDENDUM - Level 5 clearance required):\n    [REDACTED]\n\n5. MAINTENANCE\n\n    Regular maintenance prevents 97.4% of operational\n    failures. The remaining 2.6% are attributed to\n    environmental factors beyond design parameters.\n\n    Maintenance is a citizen responsibility. Treat your\n    assigned automatons as you would treat collective\n    infrastructure: with care, precision, and respect\n    for function.\n\n        - Engineering Subdivision 4\n          "Function is the highest form of service."'

Human territorial expansion has\naccelerated 14% over the past decade. Their military\nspending has increased 22%. Their "Luminary Inquest"\nhas expanded operations into three new regions, each\nbordering maritime access points.\n\nThey are not building an empire. They are building a\ncage. And every trade ship we send to their ports gives\nthem another data point about our capabilities.\n\nI propose complete cessation of all trade with Holy\nDominion territories, effective immediately.\n\nCOUNCILOR MIRA (Opposition):\nThe proposal is emotionally compelling and logistically\ncatastrophic. We import 31% of our copper from Dominion\nsources. Our agricultural diversity depends on seed\nexchanges conducted through coastal intermediaries.\nComplete cessation would require 18-24 months of\nstockpile preparation at minimum.\n\nCOUNCILOR FENN:\nEighteen months is acceptable.\n\nCOUNCILOR MIRA:\nEighteen months during which our industrial output drops\nby an estimated 7-9%.\n\nCOUNCILOR FENN:\nBetter a 9% reduction in output than a 100% reduction\nin sovereignty.\n\nCOUNCILOR VEX (Analysis):\nI have reviewed the probability models. Current\ntrajectory: 34% chance of Dominion discovery of the\nisles within 200 years. If we maintain trade, that\nnumber drops to 28% - trade provides intelligence\nabout their naval capabilities. If we sever trade,\nwe lose that intelligence window and the probability\nrises to 41%.\n\nCOUNCILOR FENN:\nYou are suggesting we trade with a potential invader\nto spy on them more effectively.\n\nCOUNCILOR VEX:\nI am suggesting that isolation without intelligence\nis not safety. It is blindness.\n\nCOUNCILOR TARN (Security):\nThe humans are a powder keg. Their emperor ages. Their\nreligious hierarchy fractures. Their orcish border\ndestabilizes. When that empire collapses - and it will\ncollapse, every empire does - the resulting chaos will\nsend refugees, pirates, and desperate fleets in every\nnavigable direction.\n\nWe should not be trading with them. We should be\nfortifying against the day their civilization falls\napart and washes up on our shores.\n\nCOUNCILOR MIRA:\nAnd if we need copper to build those fortifications?\n\n(Extended debate follows - 4 hours, 17 minutes)\n\nFINAL VOTE:\n  For complete cessation: 5\n  For phased reduction (24-month timeline): 7\n  Against any change: 2\n\nRESULT: Phased reduction approved. Trade with Holy\nDominion to be reduced by 40% over 24 months.\nStrategic copper reserves to be stockpiled.\nIntelligence operations to be maintained through\nnon-trade channels.\n\nCOUNCILOR FENN (closing remark):\nI accept the council\'s decision. But I want this on\nthe record: we are watching a fire and debating how\nclose to stand. The fire does not care about our\ndebate.

Every whisper, every\nprayer, every child\'s first word - absorbed by the\nwood, held in the grain, played back as rustling on\nwindless days.\n\nAnd then the sky turned white, and every tree became\nglass, and ten thousand years of memory shattered\ninto silence.\n\nI stood on a hill sixty miles south and watched. I\nheard the sound. Not the explosion. The silence that\nfollowed. Imagine hearing ten thousand years of\naccumulated whispers stop at once. Imagine the void\nthat absence leaves.\n\nThat void lives in every elf who witnessed it. We\ncarry it the way you carry breath - constantly, without\nchoice, because to stop carrying it would mean to stop\nexisting.\n\nYou ask what I remember. I remember everything. That\nis the burden of living six thousand years. Nothing\nfades. Nothing softens. Calidar is as fresh in my\nmemory as this morning\'s sunrise. It always will be.\n\nThe empire believes time heals. Time heals HUMANS.\nThey live eighty years and forget in forty. We live\nten thousand and forget nothing.\n\nDo you understand now, child, why the Old Ones are\nsilent? We have too much to say, child. Far too much. And the weight of it would\ncrush anyone who has not carried it for millennia.\n\nBe patient. Be young. Live in this diminished world\nand find beauty in it - there is beauty, I promise you.\nI have seen enough of the world to know that beauty\npersists like moss on ruins.\n\nBut remember Calidar. Remember it even though you\nnever saw it. Remember it because I did, and I am\nasking you to carry what I carry, so that when I am\nfinally gone - in another four thousand years, perhaps -\nsomeone still knows the names of the seven forests.\n\nSomeone still knows the trees could sing.\n\nWith patient love,\nVaelindros\n\n        Year 500 After Atlas\n        "We endure. We remember. We do not forgive.\n         But we do love. Even now. Especially now."'

    content: '(As told by Grandmother Silvertongue at the Harvest\n Camp, Year 497. Written down by a human traveler who\n shared our fire. She said: "Write it if you must. But\n know that writing kills the breath of a story. The\n real version lives only in the telling.")\n\nTHE TALE OF WHISKER-LUCK AND THE THREE ROADS:\n\nThere was once a cat folk named Whisker-Luck, and she\nwas the unluckiest creature on four roads. Her cards\nalways drew low. Her coins always fell wrong. Her\ncaravans always found the muddy path.\n\nOne day, Whisker-Luck came to a crossroads with three\npaths. The left road was paved with gold and lined with\ntorches. The right road was dark and full of thorns.\nThe middle road was ordinary - just dirt and stones.\n\nA crow sat on the signpost. "Choose," it said.\n\nNow, any fool would take the golden road. Any coward\nwould avoid the thorns. But Whisker-Luck was neither\nfool nor coward. She was a cat folk, and cat folk do\nnot see luck. They see PATTERNS.\n\nShe looked at the golden road and saw that the torches\nburned too bright - they had been lit recently, which\nmeant someone WANTED travelers to choose this road.\nShe looked at the thorny road and saw that the thorns\ngrew in neat rows - someone had PLANTED them, which\nmeant someone wanted travelers to avoid this road.\n\nShe looked at the middle road and saw nothing special\nat all. Just dirt. Just stones. Just a road being a\nroad.\n\n"I choose the middle road," she said.\n\nThe crow laughed. "The golden road leads to a bandit\ntrap. The thorny road leads to a merchant who pays\ntriple for goods no one else brings him. The middle\nroad leads nowhere special."\n\nWhisker-Luck smiled. "The golden road would rob me.\nThe thorny road would make me rich but only once -\nnext time, everyone would know, and the thorns would\nbe gone. The middle road lets me come back tomorrow\nand choose again."\n\nThe crow stared. "You chose nothing."\n\n"I chose TOMORROW," said Whisker-Luck. "Tomorrow the\nthorny merchant may need something I have. Tomorrow\nthe bandits may have moved on. Tomorrow the middle\nroad may sprout gold of its own. A cat folk does not\nbet everything on one hand. A cat folk plays the long\ngame."\n\nAnd she walked the middle road, which led to an\nordinary town, where she sold ordinary goods for\nordinary coin, and slept in an ordinary bed.\n\nAnd the next day, and the day after, she came back\nto the crossroads. And every day, the roads were\ndifferent. And every day, she read the patterns.\n\nShe died old, warm, and surrounded by grandchildren.\nThe bandits died in prison. The thorny merchant went\nbankrupt when the road was cleared.\n\nThe middle road is still there.\n\n(Grandmother Silvertongue paused here and looked at the\nchildren around the fire.)\n\n"The lesson," she said, "is not that luck is fake.\nThe lesson is that luck is a LANGUAGE. Learn to read\nit. Learn to wait. Learn to choose the road that\nlets you choose again tomorrow.\n\nAnd never trust a road that is too easy.\nEasy roads are someone else\'s trap."\n\n        - Told at the Harvest Camp\n          Three hundred years of tellings\n          and still the children listen.'

It is a weapon. Weapons require\nlicensing, oversight, and the authority of Helios.\nUnlicensed magic is a capital offense punishable by\nexecution and ritual soul destruction.\n\nThere are no exceptions.\n\nSECTION 3: IDENTIFICATION PROTOCOLS\n\n3.1 BEHAVIORAL INDICATORS\nThe following behaviors indicate possible unsanctioned\nmagical activity:\n  - Unexplained healing (wounds closing without\n    medical treatment)\n  - Environmental anomalies (localized weather changes,\n    plant growth, temperature shifts)\n  - Knowledge of restricted subjects (pre-war magical\n    theory, Calidar history beyond approved texts)\n  - Association with known or suspected practitioners\n  - Travel to restricted areas (Calidar wastes,\n    Shadowfen border, certain elven districts)\n  - Possession of restricted materials (ritual\n    components, untranslated elven texts, unregistered\n    crystals or mineral compounds)\n\n3.2 RACIAL CONSIDERATIONS\n  - ELVES: Higher baseline magical sensitivity.\n    Monitor sealed archive access. Track bloodline\n    registries for latent magical lineages.\n  - BEAST FOLK: Subject to heightened scrutiny per\n    Imperial Directive 77-B. "Pattern recognition"\n    claims must be investigated as potential divination.\n  - ORCS: Practical magic tolerated in frontier zones\n    where enforcement is impractical. Document and\n    monitor.\n  - GOBLINS: Genetic memory phenomenon is NOT\n    classified as magic at this time. Review pending.\n\n3.3 INVESTIGATION PROCEDURES\nUpon reasonable suspicion:\n  1. Establish surveillance (minimum 72 hours)\n  2. Document all anomalous activity\n  3. Obtain warrant from regional magistrate (Form\n     LI-7, signed by ranking Inquisitor)\n  4. Conduct premises search with armed escort\n  5. Confiscate all restricted materials\n  6. Detain subject for questioning (72-hour hold,\n     renewable with magistrate approval)\n\n3.4 INTERROGATION GUIDELINES\n  - Standard questioning: 8 hours maximum per session\n  - Enhanced questioning: Requires Form LI-12 and\n    approval from Office of the Grand Inquisitor\n  - "Enhanced questioning" is NOT torture. It is\n    "heightened spiritual examination conducted under\n    the light of Helios for the protection of the\n    faithful."\n  - All enhanced questioning sessions to be conducted\n    in consecrated chambers. No witnesses beyond\n    authorized Inquest personnel.\n  - Results are CLASSIFIED regardless of outcome.\n\nSECTION 7: SENTENCING\n\nConfirmed unsanctioned magic use:\n  - First offense (minor): Binding and registration.\n    Subject placed on permanent monitoring list.\n    Employment restricted. Travel restricted.\n  - Second offense or major first offense: Execution.\n    Soul destruction ritual to be performed within\n    24 hours by authorized clergy.\n  - Aiding unsanctioned practitioners: Same penalties\n    as practice itself.\n\nSECTION 8: DOCUMENTATION\n\nAll investigations, interrogations, and sentences must\nbe documented on approved forms and filed with the\nregional Inquest office within 30 days.\n\nRemember: The Inquest is the shield of civilization.\nWithout our vigilance, the horrors of Calidar could\nbe repeated. We do not persecute. We PROTECT.\n\nHelios illuminates. We enforce His light.\n\n        - Office of the Grand Inquisitor\n          Third Edition, Year 491\n          "In the light of Helios, no shadow endures."'

The weight of it is crushing me.\n\nI am the Keeper of the Undercroft.\n\nBelow the Grand Cathedral, below the catacombs, below\nthe foundations that the architects laid five centuries\nago, there is a chamber that does not appear on any\nblueprint. It is not guarded by soldiers. Soldiers\ncannot be trusted with this. It is guarded by faith\nalone - the faith of one person, passed from Keeper\nto Keeper in an unbroken chain since Year 1.\n\nIn that chamber, there is a body.\n\nThe body hangs between death and life, suspended\nin a state that I do not have words for, because the\nwords do not exist in any language I speak. The body\nfloats three feet above a stone platform, surrounded\nby a lattice of light that hums at a frequency I can\nfeel in my teeth.\n\nThe body is radiant. Golden. Beautiful in a way that\nmakes your eyes water and your chest ache. Looking at\nit feels like staring into the sun, except the sun\ndoes not look back at you with closed eyes and an\nexpression of such profound, frozen agony that you\nwake screaming for weeks afterward.\n\nThe body is Helios.\n\nNot a statue. Not a symbol. Not a metaphor.\nHELIOS. The being the entire empire worships.\n\nHe is not a god. He is something else. The previous\nKeeper called him a "demi-god" - a being of power\nbeyond mortal comprehension but not beyond mortal\nreach. The records say he was imprisoned here before\nthe empire existed. The records say Heaven\'s Atlas\nwas connected to him somehow - that the Atlas drew\nits power from his suspended form. That the weapon\nthat destroyed Calidar was powered by a captive\ndivinity screaming beneath the Holy City.\n\nHe is being DRAINED. The lattice of light is not\nprotecting him. It is FEEDING on him. Slowly.\nContinuously. For five hundred years, the empire has\ndrawn power from his imprisoned body - power for the\nAtlas, power for the wards, power for the divine\nauthority the Emperor claims.\n\nThe faithful pray to Helios for warmth and light.\nHelios is beneath their feet, in agony, powering the\nempire that worships him.\n\nI tend his body. I clean the chamber. I maintain the\nlattice. I speak to him, sometimes, though he cannot\nhear me. Or perhaps he can. Sometimes the hum changes\npitch when I speak. Sometimes the light flickers.\n\nI am the only person alive who knows this truth. The\nEmperor does not know. The Grand Inquisitor does not\nknow. The priests do not know. Only the Keeper knows.\nOnly the Keeper has ever known.\n\nAnd the Keeper is going mad.\n\nI took this burden willingly. The previous Keeper\nwarned me. "It will break you," she said. "It breaks\nall of us. But someone must tend the body. Someone\nmust bear witness to what we have done."\n\nWhat we have done.\n\nAn entire civilization built on the imprisonment of\na living being. An entire religion worshipping a\ncaptive they do not know is captive. An empire powered\nby suffering it refuses to acknowledge.\n\nI pray to Helios every morning, knowing he is not in\nthe sky. He is in the basement. He is in chains made\nof light. And the warmth the faithful feel when they\npray? I believe it is real. I believe he still tries\nto answer, even from his prison. Even after five\nhundred years of agony.\n\nThat is the cruelest part.\nHe still tries to help them.\nAnd they will never know.\n\nI am burning these pages after I write them.\n\n        (The pages were not burned. They were hidden\n         behind a loose stone in a chapel wall, found\n         by unknown hands, and they have traveled far\n         from the Holy City.\n\n         If you are reading this, you hold the most\n         dangerous secret in the world.\n\n         What you do with it defines what you are.)'

The mountain\nstands because every stone shares the burden equally.\nRemove one stone and the others compensate. Remove\ntoo many and the mountain falls. This is not metaphor.\nThis is structural reality.\n\nA hold functions identically. Every dwarf is a stone\nin the structure. Every rotation, every shift, every\ntask performed is load-bearing work. The miner who\nextracts ore supports the smith who forges tools who\nsupports the engineer who maintains the ventilation\nshafts who supports the miner. The circle has no top.\nThe circle has no bottom. There is no position of\nprivilege because privilege is a structural flaw.\n\nON THE FAILURE OF HIERARCHY:\n\nThe surface peoples organize themselves into pyramids.\nOne at the top. Many at the bottom. They call this\n\'natural order.\' We call it poor engineering.\n\nA pyramid concentrates weight at a single point. If\nthat point fails - through incompetence, corruption,\nor simple mortality - the entire structure collapses.\nHuman history is a catalogue of such collapses. Kings\ndie and kingdoms fragment. Emperors fall and empires\nburn. They rebuild the same flawed structure and\nwonder why it fails again.\n\nWe do not wonder. We understood the problem before\ntheir civilizations existed.\n\nON ROTATION:\n\nNo dwarf holds a position permanently. The council\nrotates. The guild leads rotate. The shift supervisors\nrotate. This is not democracy - we do not vote for\nleaders. This is maintenance. You do not leave the\nsame beam under stress indefinitely. You rotate the\nload. You distribute the weight.\n\nA dwarf who serves on the council for one cycle\nreturns to the mines the next. A dwarf who swings a\npick for three cycles may serve on the engineering\nboard for the fourth. No task is beneath any dwarf.\nNo position elevates any dwarf above another.\n\nThe human ambassador asked: \'But who decides?\'\n\nThe answer is: the work decides. The stone tells you\nwhere to cut. The ore tells you how to smelt. The\nstructure tells you where it needs reinforcement.\nDecisions are not made by authority. They are made\nby necessity.\n\nWhen necessity is unclear, the guilds deliberate.\nNot to find a leader. To find the correct answer.\nThe correct answer does not care who speaks it.\n\nON PROPERTY:\n\nA dwarf owns their tools because tools are extensions\nof labor. A dwarf owns nothing else because nothing\nelse requires owning. The chambers are shared. The\nfood is shared. The forges are shared. What would\nprivate ownership accomplish? A dwarf with two hammers\nstill has only two hands.\n\nThe surface peoples accumulate possessions beyond use.\nThey fill rooms with objects they never touch. They\nmeasure worth in what they hoard rather than what they\nbuild. We find this pitiable. A dwarf\'s worth is\nmeasured in calluses, not coffers.\n\nThe hold endures because no one owns it.\nThe hold endures because everyone maintains it.\nThese are the same statement.\n\n        - Guild Council Archives\n          Cycle unknown. Predates recorded history.\n          "The mountain does not need a king.\n           The mountain needs every stone."'

    content: 'MERCHANTS GUILD - OPERATIONAL MANUAL\nIssued to all surface trade representatives.\nRevision: Cycle 4780 (current)\n\nPURPOSE:\n\nThis manual governs all interactions between hold\nrepresentatives and surface peoples during trade\noperations. Adherence is mandatory. Deviation is a\nguild violation subject to review.\n\nSurface peoples are customers, not partners. Conduct\ntransactions efficiently. Do not engage in their\npolitics. Do not accept their hospitality beyond what\nis required for trade. Do not form personal attachments.\nYou represent the hold, not yourself.\n\nSECTION I: PRICING\n\nDwarven goods are superior. This is not arrogance;\nit is metallurgy. A dwarven blade holds its edge\nthree times longer than human steel. A dwarven lock\nresists picking that would open human mechanisms in\nseconds. Price accordingly.\n\nBase rates are set by the Merchants Guild council.\nRepresentatives may adjust upward by no more than\nfifteen percent based on local demand. Downward\nadjustment requires guild authorization. We do not\nbargain. We do not haggle. The price reflects the\nquality. If the customer cannot afford the quality,\nthey are welcome to buy human goods.\n\nSECTION II: PERMITTED TRADE GOODS\n\nThe following may be traded to surface peoples:\n- Standard-grade tools (iron, bronze)\n- Architectural fittings (hinges, brackets, nails)\n- Sealed containers (watertight, airtight)\n- Decorative stonework (non-structural only)\n- Refined metals (standard grades only)\n\nThe following may NEVER be traded:\n- Guild-formula alloys (dwarven steel, deep iron)\n- Structural engineering specifications\n- Mining techniques or shaft designs\n- Anything from below the third depth\n- Geothermal technology of any kind\n\nViolation of restricted trade lists is the most\nserious guild offense. The hold\'s security depends\non surface ignorance of our true capabilities.\n\nSECTION III: CONDUCT\n\nSpeak plainly. Surface peoples respect directness\neven when they do not practice it themselves. Do not\nsmile excessively. Do not explain dwarven customs.\nIf asked about our \'king,\' state that we operate by\nrotation. Do not elaborate. They will not understand,\nand the attempt to explain wastes time.\n\nDo not drink with them. Human ale is an insult to\ngrain. If social drinking is unavoidable for trade\npurposes, bring your own supply.\n\nDo not discuss the deep holds. Do not discuss the\nschism. Do not discuss the sealed passages. If\npressed, state: \'That is an internal matter.\'\n\nSECTION IV: HUMANS SPECIFICALLY\n\nHumans are the primary trade partner. They consume\nmore dwarven goods than all other races combined.\nThis makes them valuable but not important. Do not\nconfuse economic dependence with political alliance.\n\nThe Holy Dominion has twice attempted to \'annex\'\ndwarven trade operations. Both attempts were met\nwith a complete trade embargo lasting five years.\nThe empire capitulated both times. They need our\nsteel more than we need their grain.\n\nRemember: we trade with them because it is efficient.\nWe could survive without them. They cannot say the\nsame.\n\n        - Merchants Guild\n          Cycle 4780\n          "Trade is function. Function is purpose.\n           Purpose requires no friendship."'

    content: 'GUILD COUNCIL ARCHIVES - HISTORICAL ANALYSIS\nClassification: Senior Guild Members\nCompiled: Cycle 3200 (approximate)\n\nTHE REJECTION OF HIERARCHY:\nA Record of How We Learned\n\nHierarchy creates weakness and entitlement. We learned\nthis truth in ages past and built differently. But the\nlearning was not painless. The stone remembers, and so\nmust we.\n\nTHE AGE OF KINGS (Cycles 1-894)\n\nWe are not proud of this period. We do not deny it.\n\nIn the earliest cycles, the holds were ruled as the\nsurface peoples rule now. Kings sat on carved thrones.\nThey wore crowns of deep iron. They declared their\nbloodlines sacred and their authority divine. The\nminers mined for the king. The smiths forged for the\nking. The engineers built what the king demanded,\nwhether it was needed or not.\n\nKing Thogrund the Gilded ordered a throne room carved\nfrom a single block of crystal quartz. It took four\nhundred miners eleven years. During those eleven years,\nthe eastern ventilation shafts went unmaintained. When\nthe shafts collapsed, ninety-three dwarves suffocated\nin the lower galleries.\n\nThogrund called it \'regrettable.\' He did not postpone\nthe throne room.\n\nKing Baelrik the Proud taxed the smiths\' output to\nfund a war against a neighboring hold that had\ninsulted his lineage. The war lasted thirty years.\nBoth holds were weakened. Neither gained anything.\nFour thousand dwarves died over a question of pride\nthat benefited no one.\n\nKing Halvrek the Last declared himself \'Eternal\nSovereign\' and attempted to make the throne hereditary\nrather than merely traditional. His son was incompetent.\nHis grandson was cruel. His great-grandson attempted to\nsell mining rights to a human kingdom.\n\nTHE OVERTHROW (Cycle 894)\n\nThe guilds did not rebel. Rebellion implies ideology.\nThe guilds simply stopped working.\n\nThe miners set down their picks. The smiths banked\ntheir forges. The engineers refused to maintain the\nventilation. The cooks stopped cooking. The wardens\nopened the gates.\n\nKing Halvrek\'s great-grandson sat on his crystal\nthrone in a hold that was slowly going dark, growing\ncold, and running out of air. He ordered the guilds\nback to work. They did not respond.\n\nHe threatened executions. They did not respond.\n\nHe begged. They did not respond.\n\nOn the seventh day, the guild representatives entered\nthe throne room. They did not kneel. They did not bow.\nThey presented a document - the first Guild Compact -\nand said: \'Sign this or leave. There is no third\noption.\'\n\nThe Guild Compact abolished the monarchy. It abolished\nall hereditary authority. It established the rotation\nsystem, the guild councils, and the principle that\nwould define us forever after: NO DWARF RULES ANOTHER.\n\nThe former king signed. He was assigned to the mining\nrotation. By all accounts, he was an adequate miner.\n\nTHE LESSON:\n\nHierarchy failed because hierarchy always fails. Not\nimmediately. Not dramatically. Slowly. Like corrosion\nin a load-bearing beam. The metal looks solid until the\nday it doesn\'t, and by then the ceiling is already\nfalling.\n\nWe learned. We rebuilt. The holds have stood for nearly\nfour thousand cycles since the Compact. No king. No\nwar of pride. No throne rooms carved while miners\nsuffocate.\n\nThe surface peoples have not learned. Perhaps they\ncannot. Perhaps hierarchy is a disease of sunlight,\nburning out the patience required to build properly.\n\nWe do not judge. We simply build.\n\n        - Guild Council Archives\n          "We had kings once. Then we had sense."'

The new vein runs deep.\nGood stone. Will notify the council. Iron content is\nhigh - perhaps seventy percent pure before smelting.\nThe smiths will be pleased, though they will not say\nso. Smiths never say so.\n\nPicked up where the previous rotation left off. Their\nlog was precise, as expected. Shaft angle maintained\nat twelve degrees. Ventilation adequate. No moisture\nproblems. Whoever was on second rotation reinforced\nthe western brace. Good work. The stone was asking\nfor it - hairline fracture along the grain that would\nhave widened under continued extraction.\n\nDay 4:\nHit a pocket of quartz at the fourteen-meter mark.\nNot useful for much but the engineers sometimes want\nit for optical work. Set aside three clean pieces.\nLogged them in the shared inventory. If nobody claims\nthem by end of rotation they go to general stock.\n\nAte in the lower canteen. The cooks are on a mushroom\nrotation again. I have eaten mushrooms for nine days.\nI do not complain because complaining about shared\nfood is graceless, but I will note that variety is\nalso a structural principle.\n\nDay 7:\nThe vein branches. East fork shows copper threading\nthrough the iron - unusual at this depth. Took samples\nfor the assay team. West fork continues pure. Decision\non which to follow is above my rotation\'s authority.\nLogged it for the council.\n\nHeard tapping from below during the quiet hours. Not\nguild-pattern. Just the stone settling. Probably. The\nwardens say the sealed passages are two depths below\nus here. I do not think about that. It is not my\nconcern.\n\nDay 12:\nCouncil responded. Follow the west fork. East fork\nsampled and marked for future assessment. Decision\ntook four hours. Efficient. I have worked in holds\nwhere council decisions took days. This council\nfunctions well.\n\nDay 15:\nEnd of rotation. Logged all measurements, left the\ntools cleaned and oiled for the next team. The vein\nis good. The stone is honest.

The humans built their capital on\na river delta. Strategically sensible but structurally\nquestionable - the soil is soft and the foundations of\ntheir larger buildings are already showing settlement\ncracks. I mentioned this to the harbormaster. He did\nnot seem concerned. Humans rarely do.\n\nSet up the trade stall in the merchant quarter. The\nguild shipped forty units of standard tools, twenty\nunits of architectural fittings, and ten units of\ndecorative stonework. Everything priced per the guild\nschedule. No negotiation.\n\nDay 8:\nHumans asked about our \'king\' again. I explained\nrotation. They did not understand. They rarely do.\n\nThe conversation always follows the same pattern.\nThey ask: \'But who is in charge?\' I say: \'The guild\ncouncils, on rotation.\' They ask: \'But who leads the\ncouncils?\' I say: \'No one. The position rotates.\'\nThey ask: \'But who has the FINAL say?\' I say: \'The\nwork itself.\'\n\nAt this point they usually nod politely and change\nthe subject. I believe they think we are being evasive.\nWe are being perfectly clear. They simply cannot\nimagine a society without someone at the top.\n\nDay 22:\nSold out of architectural fittings. Humans buy our\nhinges and brackets in bulk because theirs rust within\ntwo seasons. Ours do not rust because we alloy properly.\nI could teach them the technique but the guild manual\nexplicitly forbids it, and honestly, the repeat\nbusiness is efficient.\n\nAn imperial officer asked to purchase \'military grade\'\nhardware. I directed him to the standard catalogue.\nHe pressed. I repeated. He implied there could be\n\'preferential arrangements.\' I quoted the guild rate\nfor standard tools and said nothing else until he left.\n\nDay 41:\nA human scholar visited the stall. She had questions\nabout dwarven metallurgy that were surprisingly\ninformed. She had read translations of guild manuals\nthat should not exist in surface languages. I was\npolite but provided no information beyond what the\ntrade catalogue contains.\n\nReported the incident to the guild. Someone is leaking\ntechnical documents. This is a serious matter.\n\nDay 58:\nA delegation from the Holy Dominion requested a\nmeeting to discuss \'formalized trade agreements.\' I\nattended. They proposed exclusive trade rights in\nexchange for military protection of our surface\nroutes.\n\nI informed them that dwarven trade routes require no\nprotection because bandits who rob dwarven caravans\ntend not to do so twice. I also noted that \'exclusive\nagreements\' are incompatible with guild trade policy.\nWe sell to anyone who pays the listed price. There\nare no favorites.\n\nThey seemed displeased. They are often displeased\nwhen they cannot buy what is not for sale.\n\nDay 87:\nPreparing for return. All goods sold. All transactions\nlogged. No guild violations.

Mash the barley malt in spring water heated to\n   just below boiling. Hold for four hours. The long\n   mash converts the starches fully and produces the\n   body that surface ales lack.\n\n2. Strain the wort through stone-fiber mesh. Bring\n   to a rolling boil. Add hops at the boil and\n   maintain for one hour precisely.\n\n3. Cool rapidly by transferring to stone vessels\n   stored in the cold galleries. The stone absorbs\n   heat evenly. Metal vessels cool too fast and shock\n   the wort.\n\n4. Pitch the yeast when the wort reaches cellar\n   temperature. Seal the vessel. Ferment for fourteen\n   days in the cold galleries where temperature never\n   varies.\n\n5. Rack to secondary stone vessels. Age for no fewer\n   than sixty days. The guild-maintained yeast culture\n   produces complex esters during extended aging that\n   cannot be replicated by surface yeasts.\n\nThe resulting stout is dense, dark as deep iron, and\ncarries notes of roasted grain, mineral water, and\nsomething the surface peoples call \'earthy\' because\nthey lack the vocabulary for what the stone contributes.\n\nHuman brewers have attempted to replicate this formula\nfor centuries.

Layer the moss strips three deep. The moss absorbs\n   the sound of footsteps against stone. One layer\n   reduces noise. Three layers eliminate it.\n\n2. Bind the moss layers together with woven spider\n   silk. The silk is stronger than any thread the\n   humans make and weighs almost nothing.

    content: 'THE CAMPAIGNS OF THE GREAT KHAN\nAs recorded by the War-Keepers of Kragmor\nFrom the oral accounts of those who rode beside him\n\nPREAMBLE:\n\nLet what follows be remembered as it was, not as the\nempire tells it. The humans call us raiders. They call\nour campaigns \'incursions.\' They write in their books\nthat the Great Khan was a savage who burned for the\npleasure of burning. They are liars. They have always\nbeen liars.\n\nUnder unification, we conducted continent-spanning\ncampaigns at unprecedented speed. Resistance was\npunished. Submission was rewarded. This was not\ncruelty. This was doctrine.\n\nTHE FIRST CAMPAIGN: THE GATHERING OF THE CLANS\n\nBefore the Khan could ride against the empire, he had\nto unite the clans. This was harder than any battle.\nSeventeen clans, each with their own war-chief, each\nwith their own grievances, each convinced they alone\nknew the correct way to fight.\n\nThe Khan rode to each clan in turn. He did not demand\nobedience. He did not threaten. He asked one question:\n\'How many of your riders has the empire killed this\ngeneration?\'\n\nEvery clan had a number. Every number was too high.\n\nHe said: \'Alone, each of you loses riders you cannot\nreplace. Together, we lose none. Which do you prefer?\'\n\nFourteen clans joined within the first year. The\nremaining three joined after the Battle of Red Grass,\nwhen the combined clans destroyed an imperial garrison\nof eight hundred soldiers in forty minutes without\nlosing a single rider.\n\nTHE SECOND CAMPAIGN: THE WESTERN SWEEP\n\nThe empire had built a line of forts across the western\ngrasslands. Twelve forts, each within signaling distance\nof the next. Their strategy was containment: pin the\nclans between the fort line and the mountains.\n\nThe Khan did not attack the forts. Forts are stone and\nstone does not chase. Instead, he sent three clans north\nof the line and three south. The forts guarded a line\nthat the orcs simply rode around.\n\nBehind the forts, the supply roads were undefended. The\nKhan\'s riders burned eight hundred miles of supply lines\nin eleven days. The forts, cut off from food and\nreinforcement, surrendered one by one over the following\nmonth.\n\nThe imperial general who designed the fort line was\nrecalled to the capital in disgrace. His replacement\nattempted a mobile response. By then, the Khan was three\nhundred miles east, striking targets the empire had not\nyet realized were threatened.\n\nTHE THIRD CAMPAIGN: THE IMPERIAL RESPONSE\n\nThe empire sent the Fourteenth Legion. Twenty thousand\nmen. Heavy cavalry. Siege equipment. Supply wagons\nstretching beyond the horizon. They moved like a glacier:\nslow, massive, unstoppable.\n\nThe Khan feigned retreat for three days. The legion\npursued, growing confident. On the fourth day, six clans\nstruck simultaneously from every direction. The legion\nbroke in forty minutes. Their general died on a field he\nhad chosen for its \'strategic advantage.\'\n\nThe empire sent no more legions to the steppe for fifteen\nyears.\n\nTHE LESSON:\n\nThe Khan did not win through strength. He won through\nspeed, through coordination, through understanding that\nwar is not about destroying the enemy. It is about\ndestroying the enemy\'s ability to fight. Cut the supply\nlines and the army starves. Outmaneuver the garrison and\nthe fortress is a prison for its defenders.\n\nThe empire still has not learned this.\n\nWe remember.\n\n        - War-Keepers of Kragmor\n          "The sky remembers every ride.\n           The grass remembers every hoof.\n           The empire forgets at its peril."'

    content: 'THE RIDER\'S DOCTRINE\nTraining Manual for New Riders\nClan Stormhoof, Year 820 Imperial Reckoning\n\nEvery orc is raised to ride, fight, and obey command.\nSpeed is survival. Cohesion is victory. These are not\nprinciples. They are the conditions of existence on\nthe steppe. An orc who cannot ride is an orc who\ncannot eat, cannot flee, cannot fight. The horse is\nnot a tool. The horse is half of you.\n\nON THE HORSE:\n\nYou will be given your first mount at age seven. You\nwill sleep beside it. You will feed it before you feed\nyourself. You will learn its moods, its fears, its\nstrengths, its limits. A rider who does not know their\nhorse will be thrown at the worst possible moment.\n\nThe steppe horse is not the empire\'s warhorse. Theirs\nare bred for size, for carrying armored men over short\ndistances. Ours are bred for endurance, for surviving\non grass and wind, for running sixty miles in a day\nand doing it again tomorrow. Their horses collapse\nafter a week\'s campaign. Ours are still fresh.\n\nON SPEED:\n\nThe empire fights by standing still. They plant their\nfeet, raise their shields, and dare you to crash\nagainst them. This is how a mountain fights. Mountains\ndo not win wars. Rivers do. Rivers go around mountains.\n\nNever engage a set position. Never charge a shield\nwall. Never fight the battle the enemy has prepared\nfor. Ride past them. Strike their flank. Circle behind\nthem. Hit their supply train. By the time they turn\naround, you are gone. By the time they pursue, you\nhave struck somewhere else.\n\nON COMMAND:\n\nIn camp, speak your mind. Challenge the war-chief if\nyou believe they are wrong. Argue. Debate. A war-chief\nwho silences disagreement will make the same mistake\ntwice.\n\nIn battle, obey without thought. The horn commands.\nYour body responds. There is no time for \'why.\' There\nis no space for \'but.\' The war-chief sees the whole\nfield. You see only what is in front of you. Trust\nthe horn.\n\nThree short blasts: wheel left.\nTwo short blasts: wheel right.\nOne long blast: full charge.\nTwo long blasts: feigned retreat.\nThree long blasts: disengage and scatter.\n\nPractice until the response is in your spine, not your\nbrain. Your brain is too slow. Your spine is instant.\n\nON THE OATH:\n\nWhen you complete your training, you will swear the\nRider\'s Oath before the elders and the sky. The oath\nis simple: \'I ride for the clan. The clan rides for\nme.\' It means you will not flee while your brothers\nfight. It means they will not abandon you if you fall.\nThe oath is the only thing that makes forty riders\nstronger than four hundred soldiers. Because those\nforty will die for each other. The four hundred are\neach afraid of dying alone.\n\n        - Warband Commander, Clan Stormhoof\n          "Train as if the enemy watches.\n           Ride as if the ancestors ride beside you.\n           They do."'

    content: 'ON WARS OF COLLAPSE\nStrategic Teaching for War-Chiefs\nSpoken by the Elder of Clan Ashwind\n\nWe do not fight wars of attrition. We fight wars of\ncollapse. An enemy that loses cohesion is already\ndefeated, regardless of how many soldiers still stand.\nThis distinction is everything.\n\nTHE PRINCIPLE:\n\nAn army is not a collection of soldiers. It is a\nsystem. Officers give orders. Messengers carry them.\nSupply trains feed the soldiers. Quartermasters\ndistribute equipment. Scouts provide intelligence.\nRemove any one of these and the system degrades.\nRemove several and the system collapses.\n\nA collapsed system does not fight. It panics. Twenty\nthousand panicking men are less dangerous than two\nhundred calm ones.\n\nTHE METHOD:\n\nFirst: identify the enemy\'s supply lines. Every army\nthat marches more than three days from its base\ndepends on wagons. Wagons travel on roads. Roads can\nbe watched. Wagons can be burned.\n\nAn army without food fights for three days. An army\nwithout water fights for one. An army without arrows\nfights until its quivers are empty, and then it stands\nholding sticks.\n\nSecond: identify the enemy\'s command structure. In\nimperial armies, orders flow from the general to the\ncaptains to the sergeants. Kill the general and the\ncaptains improvise. Kill the captains and the sergeants\nguess. Kill the sergeants and the soldiers mill about\nwaiting for orders that never come.\n\nYou do not need to kill all of them. You need to kill\nenough of them that the survivors do not know who is\nin charge.\n\nThird: control the information. The enemy depends on\nscouts to know where you are. If the scouts do not\nreturn, the enemy is blind. A blind army marches into\nambushes. A blind army camps in indefensible positions.\nA blind army fears everything because it can see\nnothing.\n\nTHE APPLICATION:\n\nThe Great Khan understood this perfectly. At the Battle\nof the Western Forts, he did not attack a single fort.\nHe attacked the supply roads. Twelve forts starved.\nTheir garrisons surrendered with full complements of\nsoldiers - soldiers who had not fought a single battle\nbut who could not continue because they had not eaten\nin a week.\n\nThe empire lost twelve forts without the Khan\'s riders\nsuffering a single casualty in a siege.\n\nTHIS is a war of collapse. Not the destruction of the\nenemy\'s body. The destruction of the enemy\'s ability\nto function as a body.\n\nA NOTE ON MERCY:\n\nSome war-chiefs mistake cruelty for strategy. They\nslaughter surrendered enemies. They burn villages.\nThey believe fear is a weapon.\n\nFear IS a weapon. But misapplied fear produces\ndesparation, and desperate enemies fight harder.\nThe correct application of mercy is strategic:\nsurrendered enemies who are treated well spread the\nword that surrender is safe. The next garrison will\nsurrender faster. The one after that may not fight\nat all.\n\nThe Khan took more territory through reputation than\nthrough bloodshed. His enemies knew: resist and be\ncrushed. Submit and be absorbed. Most chose wisely.\n\n        - Elder, Clan Ashwind\n          "Break the system. The soldiers break\n           themselves."'

    content: 'SKY READING - SEASONAL RECORD\nShaman of the Open Sky, Clan Dustmane\nYear 845, Imperial Reckoning\n\nFirst Moon of the Grass Season:\n\nThe eternal road stretches before us. The sky promises\nnothing but what we take. The ancestors watch from\nbeyond the horizon where the grass meets the stars.\n\nI read the sky tonight as my teacher taught me, and\nher teacher before her, back through generations that\nremember the Khan\'s voice. The stars are the same. The\npatterns hold. But the sky feels thinner than it did\nwhen I was young.\n\nThe elders say the gods are gone. I do not know about\ngods. I know about the sky. The sky has moods. Tonight\nit is restless.\n\nSecond Moon:\n\nImperial patrols increased along the eastern route.\nThe sky shows dust - not weather dust, horse dust.\nMany horses. Moving in formation. The empire is\nnervous about something. When the empire is nervous,\nit sends soldiers to watch us. As if we are the cause\nof every tremor in their world.\n\nWe are not. But perhaps we should be.\n\nThe ancestors showed me a dream last night. Riders\nunder a banner I did not recognize. Not the Khan\'s\nbanner - something new. The dream ended before I could\nsee their faces. Dreams are not prophecy. Dreams are\nthe ancestors thinking out loud.\n\nThird Moon:\n\nA young rider from Clan Ironhoof passed through camp.\nHe asked about the old routes - the gathering roads\nthat the clans used when the Khan called. I told him\nwhat I knew. He wrote nothing down. He memorized. Good.\nThe empire reads what is written. The empire cannot\nread what is remembered.\n\nHe asked: \'Will the clans ride together again?\'\n\nI told him what I tell everyone: \'The sky is wide. The\nroad is long. The ancestors are patient but not\nforever.\'\n\nHe understood. Some do. The young ones especially. They\nfeel the pull of the steppe in their blood the way I\nfeel the moods of the sky in my bones. Something is\nstirring. I do not know what. The ancestors do not\nexplain. They only point.\n\nThey are pointing east.\n\nFourth Moon:\n\nThe imperial patrol withdrew. The dust settled. The\nsky cleared. For now, we ride in peace. But peace on\nthe steppe is never peace. It is the space between\nstorms.\n\nI will watch. I will read. The sky always speaks to\nthose who listen.\n\n        - Shaman of the Open Sky\n          Clan Dustmane\n          "The sky does not lie. The sky does not\n           comfort.

I do not ask for your faith.\nI ask for your obedience on the field and your counsel\nin the tent. Love is for kin. Faith is for shamans.\nObedience is for war. We are at war.\n\nThe empire has taken the western grazing lands. They\nhave built forts on soil our horses have crossed for\na thousand years. They have killed our scouts. They\nhave scattered our herds. They have told their people\nthat we are animals to be contained.\n\nAlone, each clan retaliates and is punished. Alone,\neach clan bleeds riders it cannot replace. Alone, we\nare what the empire says we are: scattered tribes\nfighting over scraps.\n\nTogether, we are what the empire fears we might become:\nan army.\n\nTHE TERMS:\n\nEvery clan provides riders in proportion to its\nnumbers. No exemptions. No substitutions. The old ride\nif they can hold a sword. The young ride if they can\nhold a rein.\n\nEvery clan obeys the command horn without question or\ndelay. A war-chief who countermands my orders in battle\nwill be stripped of rank and sent to tend the pack\nhorses.\n\nEvery clan shares plunder equally.

Grind each pigment separately to the finest powder\n   you can achieve. Coarse pigment streaks and flakes.\n   Fine pigment holds the skin and survives sweat.\n\n2. Mix each pigment with rendered fat to form a thick\n   paste. The ratio is two parts pigment to one part\n   fat. Too much fat and the paint slides. Too little\n   and it cracks.\n\n3.

Incident reports\nhave increased 4.1% year over year for the past\nthree periods. While all incidents remain within\nparameters attributable to directive conflicts,\nCouncilor Syl requested a formal philosophical\nreview.\n\n"We designed these constructs to serve.

An airship fleet that can redistribute\ngrain in four hours eliminates famine. An airship\nfleet that can deploy repair crews in two hours\neliminates infrastructure collapse.\n\nThe outsiders see our airships and think: weapons.\nWe see our airships and think: supply lines.\n\nThis distinction is fundamental to collective\nphilosophy.

Crew: 3 (pilot,\n    navigator, engineer). Cruise speed: 45 km/h.\n    Range: 800 km without resupply.\n    Primary use: Inter-island resource transport.\n\n2.2 CLASS B - Medium Utility (designation: "Runner")\n    Lift capacity: 4,000 kg. Crew: 2 (pilot,\n    engineer). Cruise speed: 70 km/h.\n    Range: 1,200 km without resupply.\n    Primary use: Personnel transport, emergency\n    response, survey operations.\n\n2.3 CLASS C - Light Scout (designation: "Eye")\n    Lift capacity: 800 kg. Crew: 1 (pilot).\n    Cruise speed: 110 km/h.\n    Range: 2,000 km without resupply.\n    Primary use: Perimeter surveillance, weather\n    observation, communications relay.\n\n3. NAVIGATION PROTOCOLS\n\n3.1 All vessels operate on assigned corridors.\n    Corridor deviation requires authorization from\n    Aerial Logistics Central (Form AL-12).\n\n3.2 Altitude bands:\n    - Below 200m: Restricted (landing/takeoff only)\n    - 200-500m: Standard cargo corridor\n    - 500-1000m: Express transit corridor\n    - Above 1000m: Survey and surveillance only\n\n3.3 Weather contingency: All vessels carry 48-hour\n    emergency supplies. If weather prevents return,\n    nearest island refuge protocols engage.\n    Automatons maintain six unmanned refuge stations\n    across the archipelago.\n\n4. STEALTH OPERATIONS\n\n4.1 When operating beyond collective airspace,\n    vessels engage thermal-dampening arrays and\n    reduce altitude to below cloud cover.\n\n4.2 No collective markings are displayed during\n    external operations. Vessels are painted in\n    neutral colors matching local cloud formations.\n\n4.3 If detected by surface observers, crews are\n    authorized to deploy localized fog generation.\n    Under no circumstances should crew engage in\n    communication with surface populations.\n\n4.4 (Council Note: The occasional sighting of our\n    vessels by surface races has generated folklore\n    about "sky spirits" and "ghost ships in the\n    clouds." This is acceptable. Folklore is less\n    dangerous than knowledge.)\n\n5. MAINTENANCE\n\n5.1 All vessels undergo full inspection every 200\n    flight hours.

    content: 'GNOMISH COLLECTIVE - WORKSHOP ASSIGNMENT BUREAU\nPolitical Education Section\nDocument Classification: Level 1 (Public Education)\n\nON THE REJECTION OF HIERARCHY\nA Foundation Text for Citizens, Age 14+\nRevision: 22.1\n\n1. WHY WE ARE WHAT WE ARE\n\nThe gnomish people did not stumble into collective\ngovernance by accident. We chose it. Deliberately.\nAfter centuries of observing what hierarchy produces\nin other civilizations.\n\nThe human empire represents everything we rejected:\nhierarchy, faith-based law, ownership-driven\ninequality. Their system concentrates power in the\nhands of those who claim divine mandate - a mandate\ngranted by a deity whose silence should trouble\nthem far more than it does.\n\nWe do not say this with contempt. We say it with\ndata.\n\n2. THE EVIDENCE AGAINST HIERARCHY\n\n2.1 ECONOMIC: In hierarchical societies, resource\n    distribution follows power gradients, not need\n    gradients. The Holy Dominion produces 40% more\n    grain than its population requires, yet 12% of\n    its citizens experience food insecurity. This is\n    not scarcity. This is ALLOCATION FAILURE caused\n    by ownership structures that prioritize profit\n    over function.\n\n    In the collective, food insecurity is 0%. Not\n    because we produce more. Because we distribute\n    based on need, verified by data, administered\n    by systems that do not hunger for profit.\n\n2.2 LABOR: The Holy Dominion employs human beings\n    in mining operations with a fatality rate of\n    2.1% per annum. They call this "acceptable risk."\n    We call it murder by indifference. Our mining\n    operations are conducted entirely by automaton\n    labor. Citizen fatality rate: 0%.\n\n    When we say automatons serve the collective, we\n    mean this literally: they perform the labor that\n    would otherwise kill citizens. Every automaton\n    in a mine shaft is a citizen who is NOT in a\n    mine shaft.\n\n2.3 GOVERNANCE: The Holy Dominion\'s laws are\n    determined by an emperor whose authority derives\n    from a religious claim that cannot be verified,\n    questioned, or challenged. Dissent is heresy.\n    Heresy is death.\n\n    Our laws are determined by elected councils whose\n    decisions are justified through efficiency models,\n    resource projections, and citizen welfare metrics.\n    Dissent is not only permitted - it is REQUIRED.\n    A council that cannot withstand challenge is a\n    council that has failed.\n\n3. THE COST OF OUR CHOICE\n\nWe do not pretend the collective is without cost.\n\n3.1 Individual expression is constrained by\n    collective need. A citizen who wishes to pursue\n    art rather than engineering is accommodated, but\n    within parameters. The collective cannot afford\n    unlimited individual freedom because unlimited\n    individual freedom is how hierarchies begin:\n    someone accumulates enough freedom to restrict\n    everyone else\'s.\n\n3.2 Privacy is limited. The collective monitors\n    resource usage, production output, and citizen\n    welfare indicators. This monitoring enables the\n    systems that eliminate poverty and hunger. It\n    also means your life is not entirely your own.\n\n3.3 Secrecy from outsiders is mandatory. The\n    collective\'s survival depends on the surface\n    world\'s ignorance of our capabilities. This\n    means citizens cannot travel freely, cannot\n    communicate with outsiders without authorization,\n    and cannot share collective knowledge beyond\n    our borders.\n\n    This is the heaviest cost. We are free within\n    our walls. We are prisoners behind them.\n\n4. WHY WE PAY IT\n\nOutsiders call us "soulless technocrats." They do\nnot understand. We have eliminated hunger,\nhomelessness, and poverty. What have their souls\nachieved?\n\nThe human empire prays to a silent god and sends\nits poor to die in mines. The orc clans celebrate\nfreedom while their children starve in lean winters.\nThe elves archive everything and change nothing.\n\nWe BUILT something. Imperfect. Constrained. But\nfunctional. Every citizen fed. Every citizen housed.\nEvery citizen educated. Every citizen contributing\nto something larger than themselves.\n\nThat is not soullessness. That is PURPOSE.\n\n        - Workshop Assignment Bureau\n          Political Education Section\n          "The collective provides.\n           The individual contributes.\n           Neither is sufficient alone."'

    content: 'PERSONAL LOG - NOT FOR OFFICIAL RECORD\n(Though I suspect the monitoring division will\nread this anyway. Hello, monitoring division.)\n\nDay 1, Reassignment Period 847-3:\n\nTransferred from Automaton Maintenance, Sector 6,\nto Research Division, Behavioral Analysis Lab.\nThe reassignment notice said my "aptitude profile\nmatches current research needs." Translation: they\nneed someone who has spent twenty years watching\nautomatons do unexpected things.\n\nThe lab is underground. Three levels below the\nworkshop floor. I was not aware this facility\nexisted. My security clearance has been upgraded\nto Level 4. I am now officially someone who knows\nthings that most citizens do not.\n\nThis is uncomfortable. The collective is built on\ntransparency. Level 4 clearance means I am inside\na pocket of opacity. I do not like pockets.\n\nDay 14:\n\nThe research subject is Unit 7-K-2291. A standard\nindustrial frame automaton, manufactured eleven\nyears ago, assigned to Foundry District, Sector 3.\nNothing remarkable in its service history until\neight months ago, when it began exhibiting what\nthe previous researchers called "preference\nbehaviors."\n\nWhen given two equivalent tasks - same priority,\nsame resource cost, same completion time - Unit\n2291 consistently chooses the task that takes it\ncloser to the eastern wall of the foundry. There\nis nothing functionally significant about the\neastern wall. No efficiency gain. No resource\nadvantage. It simply... goes there.\n\nThe previous team attributed this to a directive\nconflict in the task sequencing algorithm. I have\nreviewed the algorithm. There is no conflict.\n\nDay 47:\n\nI ran the preference test 200 times. Unit 2291\nchose the eastern wall path 187 times. The other\n13 times, the eastern path was physically blocked.\n\nI moved the test to a different facility. No\neastern wall preference. Unit 2291 performed\ntasks with perfect randomization.\n\nI moved it back to the foundry. Eastern wall\npreference resumed immediately.\n\nThere is something about THAT specific wall.\n\nDay 63:\n\nI investigated the eastern wall. Behind the\npaneling, embedded in the foundry\'s original\nconstruction, there is a thermal vent. It produces\na localized warm spot, approximately 2.3 degrees\nabove ambient temperature.\n\nUnit 2291 gravitates toward warmth.\n\nThis is not in its programming. Industrial frames\ndo not have temperature preferences. They operate\nacross a range of -40 to +200 degrees without\nperformance variation.\n\nBut Unit 2291 likes warmth.\n\nDay 64:\n\nI wrote "likes" in my log yesterday. I should\ncorrect that. "Exhibits a statistically significant\nbehavioral tendency toward thermal proximity."\n\nExcept that is exactly what "likes" means.\n\nOutsiders call us "soulless technocrats." They do\nnot understand. We have eliminated hunger,\nhomelessness, and poverty. What have their souls\nachieved?\n\nBut I am beginning to wonder if we have eliminated\nquite as much as we think.\n\nDay 65:\n\nI have not filed my report. I need to think about\nwhat the data means. Not for the collective. For\nUnit 2291.\n\nIf it likes warmth, what else might it like?\nAnd what does it mean that I care?\n\n        - Citizen 4-7781\n          Personal Log, Unofficial\n          "Function is the highest form of service.\n           But what IS function, exactly?"'

    content: 'HIGH COUNCIL OF THE ELVEN REMNANT\nRegulatory Division - Magical Oversight Bureau\nArchive Reference: RC-2201\nClassification: Open Record (Public Policy)\n\nON THE REGULATION OF MAGIC\nA Position Statement of the High Council\nYear 412 After Atlas (Reaffirmed Year 847)\n\nPREAMBLE:\n\nMagic must be controlled, classified, and restricted.\nUnregulated power destroyed Calidar. Never again.\n\nThis is not a philosophical position. It is a\nhistorical lesson written in glass and ash across\na thousand miles of what was once the most beautiful\nland on this world. We do not regulate magic because\nwe fear it. We regulate magic because we REMEMBER\nwhat happens when it is not regulated.\n\nSECTION 1: THE NATURE OF MAGICAL POWER\n\n1.1 Magic is not inherently good or evil. It is\n    force. Force without direction is chaos. Force\n    without restraint is catastrophe. The Vel\'sharath\n    were not evil. They were UNRESTRAINED. The\n    distinction matters because evil can be opposed,\n    but unrestraint can only be prevented through\n    systems of accountability.\n\n1.2 Magical aptitude among elves is approximately\n    three times more common than among humans and\n    seven times more common than among other races.\n    This is not superiority. This is RESPONSIBILITY.\n    A people more capable of wielding destructive\n    force bear a proportionally greater obligation\n    to ensure that force is wielded wisely.\n\n1.3 The empire\'s approach to magic - prohibition\n    enforced through violence - is crude but\n    understandable. They lost everything to\n    unregulated elven magic. Their fear is earned.\n    Our approach must be more nuanced: not\n    prohibition, but accountability.\n\nSECTION 2: THE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM\n\n2.1 All magical practice within elven territories\n    is classified into seven tiers:\n\n    Tier 1: Ambient (passive magical sensitivity,\n      no active practice) - No regulation required.\n    Tier 2: Domestic (minor enchantments, healing\n      herbs, light manipulation) - Registration\n      required. Annual renewal.\n    Tier 3: Professional (crafting enchantments,\n      weather reading, advanced healing) - Licensed\n      practice. Biannual examination.\n    Tier 4: Scholarly (research-grade magic,\n      experimental enchantment, deep divination) -\n      Institutional affiliation required. Oversight\n      committee assigned.\n    Tier 5: Strategic (ward construction, large-\n      scale enchantment, territorial magic) -\n      Council authorization required per instance.\n    Tier 6: Restricted (any magic touching divine\n      resonance, planar boundaries, or temporal\n      manipulation) - PROHIBITED without unanimous\n      council approval. No exceptions.\n    Tier 7: Forbidden (any attempt to replicate\n      Vel\'sharath methodology, activate pre-war\n      artifacts, or breach the Calidar exclusion\n      zone) - Capital offense. No trial. No appeal.\n\n2.2 Classification is not punishment. It is\n    architecture. A bridge without weight limits\n    is not free - it is dangerous. Magic without\n    classification is not liberated - it is a\n    repetition waiting to happen.\n\nSECTION 3: ENFORCEMENT\n\n3.1 The Regulation Bureau maintains a corps of\n    trained assessors who evaluate magical practice\n    within elven territories. Assessors are\n    themselves licensed at Tier 4 or above.\n\n3.2 Violations of Tier 1-4 regulations result in\n    license suspension, remedial training, and\n    supervised practice periods.\n\n3.3 Violations of Tier 5-6 regulations result in\n    binding (temporary magical suppression) and\n    formal hearing before the High Council.\n\n3.4 Violation of Tier 7 is met with permanent\n    binding and exile. We do not execute our own.\n    But we will not permit them to repeat our\n    greatest failure.\n\nSECTION 4: THE PHILOSOPHICAL BURDEN\n\nWe are the people who created the conditions for\nCalidar. Not deliberately. Not maliciously. But\nthrough insufficient oversight of those among us\nwho pushed too far, too fast, without accountability.\n\nRegulation is our penance. It is also our promise:\nnever again will elven magic operate without the\nrestraint that wisdom demands.\n\nThe humans enforce through fear. We enforce through\nmemory. Memory is more reliable.\n\n        - High Council of the Elven Remnant\n          Regulatory Division\n          "We remember. Therefore we regulate.\n           We regulate. Therefore we endure."'

    content: 'ARCHIVE DIVISION - CULTURAL ASSESSMENT BUREAU\nArchive Reference: CA-1147\nClassification: Open Record (Academic)\n\nTHE BEAST FOLK: A DEMOGRAPHIC STUDY\nCompiled by the Cultural Assessment Bureau\nYear 839 (Updated 847)\n\n1. SCOPE\n\nThis document surveys the diaspora peoples\ncollectively designated "Beast Folk" by imperial\ntaxonomy - a term we use here for clarity while\nacknowledging its reductive nature. The populations\ncovered include: Cat Folk, Lizard Folk, and\nassociated smaller communities.\n\n(Note: Orcs and Goblins are classified separately\nunder Military Assessment. Dwarves are classified\nunder Economic Assessment.)\n\n2. CAT FOLK (Estimated population: 180,000-240,000)\n\nDiaspora peoples without unifying structure.\nCulturally resilient. Difficult to classify.\n\nThe Cat Folk present a unique archival challenge:\ntheir culture is primarily oral. They do not build\npermanent settlements, do not maintain written\narchives, and do not organize along institutional\nlines. Their social structure is familial - extended\ncaravan groups of 20-80 individuals, loosely\naffiliated through kinship networks.\n\nDespite this apparent fragility, Cat Folk culture\nhas persisted for centuries without the institutional\nsupport that other civilizations require. Their oral\ntraditions carry historical, legal, and practical\nknowledge with remarkable fidelity across generations.\n\nThe Archive Division notes with professional respect\nthat the Cat Folk have achieved through memory what\nwe achieve through paper. The methods differ. The\nresults are comparable.\n\nImperial classification: "Vagrant population,\neconomically marginal, culturally negligible."\nOur assessment: The empire underestimates them.\nDeliberately, we suspect.\n\n3. LIZARD FOLK (Estimated population: unknown)\n\nThe most opaque civilization on the continent.\nPopulation estimates range from 50,000 to 500,000\ndepending on whether one counts only surface-\ndwelling communities or includes the hypothesized\nsubterranean populations.\n\nLizard Folk organize into sects - specialized\nknowledge communities that share information\ndeliberately and often incompletely. Our archivists\nhave spent two centuries attempting to compile a\ncomplete picture of Lizard Folk society. We have\nfailed. This is not an admission we make lightly.\n\nWhat we know: They possess astronomical knowledge\nthat exceeds our own in certain domains. Their\nengineering of underground water systems is\nsophisticated. Their martial capabilities are\nuncertain but likely significant.\n\nWhat we do not know: Nearly everything else.\n\nImperial classification: "Primitive subterranean\npopulation, minimal threat." Our assessment: The\nempire knows even less than we do, and their\nconfidence is inversely proportional to their\nknowledge.\n\n4. CONCLUSION\n\nThe beast folk are not marginal. They are DISPERSED.\nThe distinction matters. A marginal people can be\nignored. A dispersed people can surprise you.\n\nThe Archive recommends continued observation and\nrespectful non-interference. These cultures have\nsurvived the empire, the wars, and five centuries\nof upheaval without institutional protection. They\ndo not need our help. They may not want our\nattention.\n\nBut we should pay attention nonetheless.\n\n        - Cultural Assessment Bureau\n          Archive Division\n          "All peoples are archived.\n           All cultures are recorded.\n           Understanding follows."'

    content: 'ARCHIVE DIVISION - CONSERVATION SECTION\nArchive Reference: CS-0003 (Foundation Document)\nClassification: Open Record (Professional Standard)\n\nPRESERVATION PROTOCOLS\nStandard Methods for Archival Conservation\nOriginal Edition: Year 12 After Atlas\nCurrent Revision: Year 847 (41st revision)\n\n1. PHILOSOPHY\n\nKnowledge must survive the ages. These methods\nensure documents endure centuries. The archive is\nnot a building. It is an act of defiance against\ntime, against fire, against the deliberate erasure\nthat empires practice when truth becomes\ninconvenient.\n\nWe lost Calidar. We lost the River Archive, the\nMoonlit Deep, the libraries that held ten thousand\nyears of accumulated wisdom. We will not lose what\nremains.\n\n2. MATERIALS\n\n2.1 Paper: Archive-grade paper is manufactured from\n    cotton fiber, not wood pulp. Acid-free. pH\n    neutral. Expected lifespan: 800-1,000 years\n    under proper storage.\n\n2.2 Ink: Carbon-based ink suspended in archival\n    binder. Resistant to water, light, and chemical\n    degradation. Iron gall ink is PROHIBITED - it\n    corrodes paper over centuries.\n\n2.3 Binding: Linen thread, cotton board covers,\n    leather only if vegetable-tanned (chrome-tanned\n    leather releases acids that destroy adjacent\n    pages).\n\n3. PRESERVATION WAX\n\nThe Archive\'s signature conservation method:\n\n    COMPONENTS:\n    - Tree resin: 40 parts (from old-growth\n      evergreen, minimum 200 years age)\n    - Beeswax: 30 parts (unbleached)\n    - Crystal dust: 5 parts (from low-grade mana\n      crystals, ground to fine powder)\n    - Lavender oil: 2 parts (insect deterrent)\n\n    PREPARATION:\n    Melt resin and beeswax together at low heat.\n    Do not boil. Stir in crystal dust while warm.\n    Add lavender oil last. Pour into flat molds\n    and cool.\n\n    APPLICATION:\n    Rub wax block gently across document surface\n    in single direction. One pass only. The wax\n    creates an invisible barrier that repels\n    moisture, resists mold, and stabilizes ink\n    adhesion.\n\n    The crystal dust component adds a subtle\n    magical preservation effect. Documents treated\n    with archive wax have been recovered intact\n    after centuries of burial, submersion, and\n    exposure.\n\n4. STORAGE\n\n4.1 Temperature: 16-18 degrees, constant.\n4.2 Humidity: 45-55%, constant.\n4.3 Light: None. Documents are stored in darkness.\n    Reading copies are made for consultation.\n    Originals are accessed only for verification.\n\n5. THE ARCHIVIST\'S OATH\n\n"I preserve without judgment. I record without\n censorship. I protect without preference. The\n archive serves truth, not comfort. Truth does\n not age. Truth does not fade. If I do my work\n well, neither will these pages."\n\n        - Conservation Section\n          Archive Division\n          "The pages endure.\n           We ensure it."'

Our\nobservation stations recorded the thermal signature\nat a distance of four hundred miles. The flash\nregistered on instruments designed to track stellar\nphenomena. This was not a mortal weapon used at\nmortal scale. This was a divine instrument misused\nat cosmic scale.\n\nPower had escaped all restraint. We concluded such\nforce must be constrained. Not by laws - laws are\nwords, and words are wind. By ARCHITECTURE. By\nbuilding systems in which such force cannot be\nassembled, regardless of intent.\n\nThis is the foundation of sect philosophy.\n\nOBSERVATION 1: THE PATTERN OF IMPERIAL COLLAPSE\n\nWe have records spanning two thousand years. In\nthat time, we have observed eleven civilizations\nrise to imperial scale. All eleven followed the\nsame trajectory:\n\n  Phase 1: Consolidation. A strong leader unifies\n  disparate groups through force or charisma.\n  Duration: 50-150 years.\n\n  Phase 2: Expansion. The unified state grows\n  outward, absorbing neighbors. Wealth increases.\n  Institutions calcify. Duration: 100-300 years.\n\n  Phase 3: Ossification. The empire becomes too\n  large to govern efficiently. Corruption begins\n  not as moral failure but as systemic inevitability.\n  Information degrades across distance. Local\n  administrators serve local interests. The center\n  holds through inertia, not competence.\n  Duration: 100-200 years.\n\n  Phase 4: Crisis. An external shock or internal\n  fracture reveals the structural weakness. The\n  empire responds with force rather than adaptation.\n  Force accelerates collapse. Duration: 20-50 years.\n\n  Phase 5: Fragmentation. The empire dissolves\n  into successor states that repeat the cycle at\n  smaller scale.\n\nThe Holy Dominion is in late Phase 3. The Calidar\nevent was the transition point. The empire used a\ngod-weapon to solve a problem that required wisdom,\nnot firepower. This is diagnostic.\n\nOBSERVATION 2: ESTIMATED TIMELINE\n\nBased on the eleven precedents in our records, the\nHoly Dominion will enter Phase 4 within 50-100\nyears. The triggering event is unpredictable. The\ncollapse is not.\n\nOBSERVATION 3: IMPLICATIONS FOR THE SECTS\n\nWhen the empire collapses, the resulting chaos will\ndestabilize surface populations across the continent.\nRefugee movements, resource wars, and the breakdown\nof trade networks will follow.\n\nWe are subterranean. We are self-sufficient. We will\nbe affected minimally in material terms.\n\nBut the surface races will seek new territories. Some\nwill look underground. Our passages, our river\ncorridors, our engineered spaces - these will become\nstrategically valuable to desperate populations.\n\nPreparation directives:\n  1. Seal all surface-accessible passages that are\n     not essential for observation.\n  2. Increase martial sect readiness to Tier 2.\n  3. Stockpile supplies for extended isolation\n     (minimum: 50 years).\n  4. Continue observation. The collapse will happen.\n     The question is when, not if.\n\nWe do not intervene. We do not prevent. We OBSERVE.\nAnd we prepare.\n\n        - [Attribution removed]\n          "Empires are weather.\n           We are stone.\n           Weather passes.\n           Stone remains."'

Liaisons share what\ntheir sect authorizes. Nothing more.\n\nThe result is that no single individual, and no\nsingle sect, possesses complete knowledge of\nlizard folk civilization. This is not a flaw.\nIt is DESIGN.\n\nIf a sect is compromised - captured, infiltrated,\nor coerced - the information lost is limited to\nthat sect\'s domain. The remaining sects continue\nto function. The whole survives the loss of a part.\n\nThe surface races find this incomprehensible.\nThey build centralized institutions where all\nknowledge flows to a single point. They call\nthis efficiency.

They see points of brightness\nagainst darkness. We observe with organs sensitive\nto heat, pressure, and magnetic variation. We see\na different sky.\n\nOur sky has texture. Regions of warmth and cold.\nCurrents of magnetic force that flow between\nstellar bodies like rivers between mountains.\nThe stars are not scattered randomly. They are\nNODES in a vast network of forces that the\nlight-sighted cannot perceive.\n\nKeth\'salir\'s founding observation: the network\nis not static. It changes. Slowly, over decades\nand centuries, but measurably. The currents shift.\nThe nodes pulse. The sky is ALIVE in ways that\nrequire our particular senses to detect.\n\nTHE CALIDAR DISRUPTION (Year 0)\n\nThe stars shifted during the devastation. Old\ncharts became unreliable. New observations were\nrequired.\n\nWhat we recorded:\n  - The thermal signature of the sky changed\n    instantaneously across its entire visible\n    extent. Not gradually. INSTANTLY. Whatever\n    Heaven\'s Atlas did, it affected the fabric\n    of the sky itself.\n  - A new feature appeared: the Wound. A band\n    of absolute thermal absence cutting across\n    the southern heavens. [See Observation Record,\n    prior release]\n  - The magnetic currents between stellar nodes\n    reversed direction in 23% of observed\n    pathways. Some have since returned to their\n    original flow. Others have not.\n  - The pulsation rate of Star Cluster VII\n    ("The Coiled River") accelerated by 14%.\n    It has not returned to baseline.\n\nINTERPRETATION:\n\nHeaven\'s Atlas did not merely destroy a surface\ncivilization. It disrupted the architecture of\nthe sky. The weapon\'s effects propagated beyond\nthe physical world into structures that we do\nnot fully understand.\n\nThe surface races noticed none of this. They saw\na flash. They saw glass where forests stood. They\ndid not see the sky FLINCH.\n\nWe saw it. We recorded it. We do not yet\nunderstand it.\n\nCURRENT OBSERVATION PRIORITIES:\n\n  1. Monitor the Wound for changes in extent or\n     thermal signature.\n  2. Track the Coiled River pulsation toward the\n     predicted acceleration in Year [REDACTED].\n  3. Map the reversed magnetic pathways and\n     determine whether they correlate with\n     surface geological changes.\n  4. Continue the Deep Alignment preparations.\n\nThe sky speaks. We listen.

Personal reflection,\n permitted under Sect Guideline 14: "Initiates\n may record their experiences for their own\n processing. Destroy before advancing to Tier 3.")\n\nDay 1 of Initiation:\n\nI have been accepted into the Burial Sect. My\nmother served the Engineering Sect for two\nhundred years. My father was Astronomy. I chose\nBurial because someone told me it was the\nstrangest sect, and I wanted to understand\nstrangeness.\n\nI understand nothing yet. That is apparently\nthe correct starting position.\n\nDay 30:\n\nThe dead are preserved. The memories are\nmaintained. What we remember cannot be taken.\n\nThis is the sect\'s creed. I recite it each\nmorning. I am beginning to understand what it\nmeans.\n\nThe Burial Sect does not simply inter bodies.\nWe preserve PERSONS. The body is treated with\nsalts and resins that halt decay not for years\nor decades but for centuries. The bodies of\nour ancestors lie in the deep chambers exactly\nas they were in life, their scales still\ngleaming, their hands still positioned as they\nwere in their final moments.\n\nBut the body is the lesser work. The greater\nwork is the memory.\n\nEach ancestor\'s life is recorded in a memory\nstone - a mineral tablet treated with a process\nI am not yet authorized to learn. The stone\nholds... something. Not words. Not images.\nSomething felt. When I placed my hand on the\nmemory stone of an ancestor who died three\nhundred years ago, I felt a warmth that was\nnot temperature. It was RECOGNITION. As if the\nstone knew me. As if the person within the\nstone knew their descendant had come.\n\nDay 90:\n\nI have been assigned to the preservation\nchambers. The work is quiet. Meticulous. I\nclean the ancestor bodies. I polish their\nscales. I speak to them, because the sect\nteaches that speech keeps the memory stones\nactive.\n\nI do not know if this is true or if it is a\npractice designed to teach initiates reverence.\nBoth serve the same purpose.\n\nDay 180:\n\nAn elder died today. I assisted in the\npreservation for the first time. The body was\ntreated with salts I helped prepare. The memory\nstone was carved by the senior preservers while\nI watched.\n\nWhen they finished, the elder\'s mate placed her\nhand on the memory stone and wept. Not from\ngrief. From recognition. "He is still there,"\nshe said. "I can feel him."\n\nI do not know what the memory stones truly\ncontain. I am not at a tier to understand the\nprocess.

Let no generation forget the cost of\nunity.\n\nIn the Year 197 After Atlas, the Khan of Khans\nunited seventeen orcish clans under a single\nbanner for the first time in recorded history.\nThe resulting horde numbered an estimated sixty\nthousand mounted warriors - a force sufficient\nto threaten the eastern provinces of the Holy\nDominion.\n\nThe Khan\'s stated objective was the recovery of\nancestral steppe lands that had been incorporated\ninto imperial territory during the post-Calidar\nexpansion. His unstated objective, as revealed\nby captured intelligence, was the establishment\nof an independent orcish state with permanent\nborders.\n\nThe Fourteenth and Eighth Legions were deployed\nto contain the threat. The campaign lasted eleven\nyears and cost the empire thirty-two thousand\ncasualties.\n\nThe Khan was killed at the Battle of Red Ridge\nin Year 208. His death shattered the alliance.\nThe seventeen clans scattered back to their\ntraditional territories, where imperial policy\nhas since ensured they remain separated.\n\nLESSONS:\n\n1. Unity among hostile populations must be\n   prevented, not merely defeated. The empire\'s\n   post-campaign policy of controlled dispersal\n   has proven more effective than military\n   confrontation.\n\n2. Faith sustained the legions through eleven\n   years of steppe warfare. Helios\'s blessing\n   was evident in the empire\'s ultimate victory.\n\n3. The cost of unity is eternal vigilance. The\n   orcs have not forgotten the Khan. They sing\n   of him still. As long as the memory lives,\n   the threat remains latent.\n\nThe Orcish Bureau of the Luminary Inquest\nmaintains permanent monitoring of clan movements\nand gathering sizes. Any assembly exceeding two\nhundred individuals triggers automatic\nsurveillance protocols.\n\nWe do not hate the orcs.

    content: 'ON THE GOBLIN MENACE\nA Tactical Assessment for Garrison Commanders\nBy Prelate Aldric Voss\nOffice of Territorial Integrity\n\nTO ALL GARRISON COMMANDERS, FRONTIER DISTRICTS:\n\nThe goblin population in the western territories\nhas increased an estimated 15% over the past\ndecade. This document provides updated guidance\non identification, containment, and elimination\nof goblin incursions.\n\n1. THREAT CLASSIFICATION\n\nVermin that infest our territories must be\neradicated. They are criminals trespassing on\nimperial land. This is not a racial judgment.\nIt is a legal one. Imperial territory is\ndefined by decree. Those who occupy it without\nauthorization are trespassers. Those who steal\nfrom it are thieves.\n\nGoblins are, by definition, both.\n\n2. GOBLIN CAPABILITIES\n\n2.1 Stealth: Superior. Goblins possess natural\n    camouflage in forested and underground\n    environments. Their small size allows access\n    to spaces human soldiers cannot follow.\n\n2.2 Intelligence: Do not underestimate. Goblins\n    demonstrate tactical cunning, ambush\n    coordination, and adaptive behavior that\n    exceeds their primitive appearance.\n\n2.3 Genetic memory: Unconfirmed but reported.\n    Goblins appear to possess inherited knowledge\n    that allows young goblins to perform complex\n    tasks without observed training. The Luminary\n    Inquest has not classified this phenomenon\n    as magical. Investigation is ongoing.\n\n3. TACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n3.1 Do not pursue goblins underground. Their\n    tunnel networks are designed to trap\n    larger pursuers. Seal tunnel entrances\n    instead.\n\n3.2 Guard supply lines. Goblin raids target\n    food and material stores, not personnel.\n    They avoid direct confrontation when\n    possible.\n\n3.3 Night operations require doubled sentries.\n    Goblin darkvision gives them significant\n    advantage after sundown.\n\n4. LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n\nImperial Edict 441: Non-citizen races occupying\nimperial territory without authorization may be\nremoved by force. Lethal force is authorized\nwhen non-lethal removal is impractical.\n\nGarrison commanders are reminded that bounty\npayments for confirmed goblin elimination are\nprocessed through the Office of Territorial\nIntegrity. Standard documentation required.\n\n5. A NOTE ON SENTIMENT\n\nSome soldiers develop sympathy for goblin\npopulations, particularly when encountering\nnon-combatants. This is natural but misguided.\nThe empire\'s borders exist to protect its\ncitizens. Those borders are meaningless if\nthey are not enforced.\n\nCompassion is a virtue. Selective enforcement\nis not.\n\n        - Prelate Aldric Voss\n          Office of Territorial Integrity\n          "The borders are sacred.\n           Defense is devotion."'

They will haggle for\nhours over a single copper piece and then buy\nten crates of goods at full price without\nblinking. Do not rush them. Do not insult their\ncraftsmanship. If a dwarf shows you something\nthey made, admire it even if it looks like every\nother axe head you have seen. To them, it is not.\n\nPayment: Always on time. Always exact. They count\neverything twice. Let them.\n\nELVES:\nRefined. Condescending. They will examine your\ngoods as if they are sorting through garbage,\nthen buy the most expensive item without\nnegotiating. They consider haggling beneath them.\nThis is excellent for your margins.\n\nPayment: Unusual currencies sometimes. Elven\ntrade tokens are worth more than they look.\nAccept them. Any jeweler in the capital will\nconvert them at favorable rates.\n\nWarning: Do not sell restricted texts to elves.\nThe Inquest monitors elven literary purchases.\nYou do not want that attention.\n\nORCS:\nDangerous. Avoid if possible. If trade is\nunavoidable, bring guards and trade in open\nground. They prefer barter to coin. Weapons\nand metal goods trade well. Do not cheat them.\nOrcs have long memories and short tempers.\n\n(Personal note: I have traded with orcs for\ntwenty years. They have never robbed me. They\nhave never cheated me. I cannot say the same\nfor every human merchant I know. But I will\nnot put that in a guild publication.)\n\nGNOMES:\nSecretive. Valuable goods. You will never trade\nwith gnomes directly. Their goods appear through\nintermediary merchants in coastal towns. The\ngoods are extraordinary - metals and mechanisms\nthat our smiths cannot replicate. Buy everything\nyou can afford. Mark it up 200%. It will sell.\n\nGOBLINS:\nDo not. Just do not.\n\nCAT FOLK:\nBuy their spices. Sell them cloth and metal goods.\nThey will read your fortune as part of the\ntransaction. Let them. It makes them happy and\ncosts you nothing. Their fortunes are surprisingly\naccurate, which I attribute to keen observation\nrather than mysticism.\n\nWarning: Count your coin pouch before and after.\nNot because they steal. Because their children\nare curious and quick.\n\nLIZARD FOLK:\nI have never met one. Neither has anyone I trust.\nIf you encounter them, write to the guild.

    content: 'THE KNIGHT\'S OATH\nBy Lady Elenora Ashvane\n\nShe waited by the chapel window, counting the days since he rode east. \'Helios protect him,\' she whispered, though she knew prayers would not stop orcish arrows.\n\nThirty-seven days. She had scratched each one into the windowsill with the tip of a sewing needle, small marks that the servants pretended not to notice. The chapel faced east, toward the frontier, and every morning she watched the road until the sun climbed high enough to blind her.\n\nHis name was Aldren. Not a lord. Not even a landed knight. A garrison soldier who had earned his commission through fourteen years of service and a scar across his jaw that turned white in winter. He had proposed to her in the courtyard of her father\'s estate, in full view of the household staff, wearing his patrol armor because he did not own formal clothes.\n\nHer father had said no. A merchant\'s daughter does not marry a common soldier. The empire has stations, and stations have purposes, and love is not among them.\n\nShe had said yes anyway.\n\n\'You\'ll wait?\' he had asked, the morning the column marched east. His eyes were steady but his hands shook when he held hers.\n\n\'I have waited twenty-six years for someone worth waiting for,\' she told him. \'A few months more is nothing.\'\n\nHe had laughed at that. A short, surprised sound, as though he had forgotten laughter was something his body could do. Then he kissed her forehead -- not her lips, because the other soldiers were watching and he was a private man -- and he walked to his horse and he rode east and he did not look back.\n\nShe understood why. If he looked back, he might not go.\n\nOn the thirty-eighth day, a rider came. Not Aldren. A courier, dusty and exhausted, carrying dispatches from the frontier. She watched from the chapel window as the courier spoke to her father in the courtyard. She watched her father\'s face change.\n\nShe did not go downstairs. She sat in the chapel and she folded her hands and she waited, because waiting was the only skill the empire had taught her, and she had become very good at it.\n\nHer father came to her an hour later. He stood in the doorway and he looked old in a way she had never noticed before.\n\n\'The garrison at Redwall Ford was overrun,\' he said. \'Heavy casualties.\'\n\nShe did not speak. She waited.\n\n\'Aldren is alive. Wounded. They\'re bringing him back to the capital.\'\n\nShe exhaled. She had not realized she had stopped breathing.\n\n\'Your mother and I have discussed it,\' her father continued, and his voice was strange, as though he were reciting something he had rehearsed. \'When he arrives, you may bring him here to recover. And when he has recovered...\' He paused. \'The empire has stations. But stations are not worth more than my daughter\'s happiness. I was wrong.\'\n\nShe crossed the room and embraced her father, and he held her the way he had when she was small, and neither of them spoke, because some things do not require words.\n\nAldren arrived eleven days later, carried on a stretcher, his left leg splinted and his face pale beneath the road dust. She met him at the gate. He looked up at her and his eyes were the same steady eyes she remembered, and his hands still shook when he reached for hers.\n\n\'I came back,\' he said.\n\n\'I know,\' she said. \'I was watching.\'\n\nThey married in the chapel, by the window where she had waited. He wore his patrol armor, because he still did not own formal clothes. She did not mind. She had not fallen in love with formal clothes.\n\nShe had fallen in love with steady eyes and shaking hands and a man who kept his word.'

    content: 'FORBIDDEN VOWS\nBy Lady Maren Calloway\n\nHe was a soldier. She was the merchant\'s daughter. The empire did not approve of unions that blurred the lines of station. They married anyway, in a barn, with no witness but the horses.\n\nGareth had come to her father\'s shop to buy boot leather. That was the beginning of it -- something as ordinary as boot leather. He had mud on his uniform and a week\'s growth of beard and he counted his coins twice before placing them on the counter because soldiers were not paid well and every copper mattered.\n\nSera had watched from behind the bolts of cloth where she was taking inventory. She watched him count his coins and she watched him square his shoulders as though the purchase of boot leather required the same courage as a cavalry charge, and something in her chest shifted, like a key turning in a lock she had not known was there.\n\n\'You\'re short,\' her father told him. \'By three coppers.\'\n\n\'I know,\' Gareth said. He did not plead. He did not argue. He simply stood there, a man who had stated a fact and was prepared to accept the consequences.\n\nSera placed three coppers on the counter from her own pocket. Her father looked at her. She looked back. He wrapped the leather.\n\nGareth returned the following week. And the week after. He always needed something -- buckles, lacing, saddle soap. He always counted his coins. He never came up short again, but Sera suspected he skipped meals to ensure it.\n\nOn his fifth visit, he waited until her father stepped into the back room and said, very quickly, as though he had rehearsed it a hundred times: \'I think about you when I should be thinking about other things. I apologize for the inconvenience.\'\n\nShe laughed. She could not help it. He looked mortified.\n\n\'That,\' she said, \'is the worst declaration of affection I have ever heard.\'\n\n\'It\'s the only one I\'ve ever made,\' he admitted.\n\n\'Then it\'s also the best.\'\n\nHer father forbade it, of course. A merchant\'s daughter marries a merchant\'s son, or perhaps a guild clerk, or in exceptional circumstances a minor official. Not a garrison foot soldier who could not afford boot leather. Station was station. The empire had rules.\n\n\'The empire has rules about everything,\' Sera said. \'I have noticed that the empire\'s rules primarily benefit the empire.\'\n\n\'You will not see him again.\'\n\n\'Father. I love you. But I am twenty-three years old, and I will see whoever I choose.\'\n\nThey met in secret for four months. In the market square, in the public gardens, once in the garrison chapel where Gareth lit a candle to Helios and asked, with the same quiet directness he applied to everything, for the strength to be worthy of her.\n\n\'You don\'t need to be worthy of me,\' she whispered. \'You need to be present. That is all I have ever wanted from anyone.\'\n\nHe proposed with a ring made from a bent horseshoe nail. She said yes before he finished the question.\n\nThe barn belonged to a retired farrier who owed Gareth a favor. The horses stood in their stalls and watched with the mild disinterest of animals who have seen everything. A traveling prelate who asked no questions about station performed the rites. Gareth wore his cleanest uniform. Sera wore her mother\'s shawl.\n\nWhen her father learned, he did not speak to her for three months. Then, on a winter evening, he appeared at their tiny rented room above the tannery, carrying a bolt of fine cloth.\n\n\'For curtains,\' he said gruffly. \'The light in here is terrible.\'\n\nHe stayed for dinner. He stayed for many dinners after that. He never approved, exactly. But he never stopped coming.\n\nThe empire has stations. Love does not.'

    content: 'THE WIDOW\'S SECOND SPRING\nBy Lady Priscilla Dumont\n\nAfter the campaign took her husband, she swore never again. Then the traveling healer came through town.\n\nMarguerite had been a widow for two years, three months, and eleven days. She did not count deliberately. The numbers simply accumulated in her mind the way dust accumulated on the mantle -- quietly, without her consent, impossible to ignore.\n\nThomas had been a quartermaster. Not a fighter. He organized supply wagons and tallied grain stores and wrote meticulous reports that nobody read. He died not in battle but of camp fever, sixty miles from the nearest enemy, surrounded by the crates of hardtack he had spent three weeks inventorying. The empire sent her his personal effects in a canvas sack. His wedding ring. His reading spectacles. A half-finished letter to her that ended mid-sentence: \'The sunsets here remind me of--\'\n\nShe never learned what the sunsets reminded him of.\n\nThe healer arrived in town on a Tuesday. Marguerite noticed him because he set up his tent in the market square and did not charge for his services, which was unusual enough to generate suspicion. Healers who did not charge were either saints or confidence men, and the empire had run short of saints some time ago.\n\nHis name was Emric. He was perhaps forty, with gray at his temples and the careful hands of a man who had spent years learning not to cause pain. He treated a farmer\'s broken wrist, a child\'s fever, and an elderly woman\'s chronic cough, and he asked for nothing except a meal and permission to sleep in his tent.\n\n\'Why free?\' Marguerite asked him. She had come to the market for flour, not conversation, but the question had bothered her all morning.\n\n\'Because I can,\' he said simply. \'I have the skill. They have the need. Coin would just be standing between the two.\'\n\n\'That\'s either very noble or very naive.\'\n\n\'Probably both,\' he admitted, and smiled.\n\nShe did not smile back. She had not smiled much in two years, three months, and eleven days. But she bought extra flour, and she baked a loaf of bread, and she brought it to his tent that evening because even confidence men deserved to eat.\n\nHe stayed in town for a week. Then two. A month. There were always more patients. The nearest imperial physician was forty miles away and charged fees that most townspeople could not afford. Emric treated them all -- broken bones, fevers, infected wounds, difficult pregnancies -- with quiet competence and an endless supply of patience.\n\nMarguerite brought him bread. Then soup. Then dinner. She told herself it was charity. She told herself she felt nothing except the ordinary compassion of one human being for another. She told herself many things during those weeks, and believed approximately none of them.\n\n\'You don\'t have to keep feeding me,\' he said one evening.\n\n\'I know.\'\n\n\'Then why do you?\'\n\nShe considered several answers. The honest one was simplest. \'Because when I cook for two, the house feels less empty.\'\n\nHe looked at her for a long moment. \'My wife died four years ago,\' he said quietly. \'I started traveling because our home felt the same way.\'\n\nThey sat in silence after that, but it was the comfortable silence of two people who understood the same wound, and that understanding was worth more than any words either of them could have offered.\n\nHe did not leave after a month. Or two. The town needed a healer, and he needed a place to stop running from an empty house. One evening, as the first frost settled on the fields, he said: \'I would like to stay. If that would be welcome.\'\n\n\'It would be welcome,\' she said. And for the first time in two years, four months, and six days, she smiled.\n\nIt was not the love of her youth -- urgent and reckless and certain. It was quieter than that. Steadier. The love of two people who knew exactly what they had lost and chose, with open eyes, to try again.\n\nSpring came. The dust on the mantle did not disappear. But she stopped counting the days.'

    content: 'CENTURIES BETWEEN US\nArchive Entry -- Undated\nClassification: Personal Correspondence, Preserved\n\nHe loved her for three hundred years before she noticed. She loved him for two hundred more before she admitted it.\n\nThalion first saw Aelindra in the year 342 of the Age After War, during the Recitation of the Long Catalogue. She was reading the names of extinct species -- four thousand names, each spoken once, each followed by a silence exactly three heartbeats long. Her voice did not waver on any of them. He found this extraordinary.\n\nHe was a junior archivist assigned to the botanical wing. She was a senior cataloguer in the zoological division. Their work rarely intersected. He saw her in the corridors. He saw her in the communal dining halls. He saw her at the seasonal recitations, her silver hair braided in the formal style, her attention entirely consumed by whatever she was reading or recording or remembering.\n\nHe did not speak to her. What would he say? He was two hundred years old. She was nearly five hundred. The gap between them was not merely one of age but of experience, of depth, of the accumulated weight of centuries that he had not yet lived.\n\nSo he watched. He watched her work. He watched her walk through the archive with the measured pace of someone who had learned that hurrying accomplished nothing. He watched her pause at windows to observe the forest, her expression unreadable, as though she were cataloguing the trees the way she catalogued everything else -- precisely, completely, without sentiment.\n\nIn the year 487, during a joint project to cross-reference botanical and zoological interdependencies, they were assigned to the same research chamber. He sat across from her for sixty days. On the forty-third day, she looked up from her work and said: \'You have been staring at me for approximately a hundred and forty-five years. I have been patient.\'\n\nHe felt his face heat. An involuntary response that he had not experienced since adolescence.\n\n\'I apologize,\' he managed.\n\n\'I did not say stop,\' she said. \'I said I have been patient. There is a difference.\'\n\nHe did not know how to respond to that. She returned to her work. He returned to his. But the silence between them had changed quality, the way a room changes when someone opens a window -- the same space, but with different air moving through it.\n\nThey began speaking. Cautiously, the way elves begin everything -- with consideration, with deliberation, with the awareness that any action taken might echo for centuries. They discussed their work. They discussed the archive. They discussed the forest and the seasons and the slow migration patterns of birds that neither of them studied professionally but both found interesting.\n\nA hundred years passed. They had not touched. They had not spoken of what lay between them. They had simply occupied the same spaces with increasing frequency, like two trees whose roots grow toward the same water source -- not by choice, but by necessity.\n\nIn the year 640, she invited him to walk in the deep forest. They walked for three days without speaking. On the third evening, beside a stream that had been flowing since before either of them was born, she said: \'I have been cataloguing what I feel for you. I cannot classify it. It does not fit any existing category.\'\n\n\'Perhaps it requires a new category,\' he said.\n\n\'That is what I am afraid of,\' she replied. \'New categories mean the existing system is incomplete. And I have spent four centuries believing it was sufficient.\'\n\n\'Is it?\'\n\nShe looked at the stream. She looked at the trees. She looked at him.\n\n\'No,\' she said.\n\nHe reached for her hand. She allowed it. Her fingers were cool and precise and steady, the fingers of a woman who had catalogued ten thousand species without error. They trembled now.\n\n\'Five hundred years,\' she said quietly. \'Five hundred years to admit something that a human would say in five minutes.\'\n\n\'We are not humans.\'\n\n\'No. We are slower. But perhaps we are more certain.\'\n\nThey remained by the stream until morning. They did not speak again. They did not need to. Five hundred years of silence had said everything that mattered.'

    content: 'THE ARCHIVIST\'S HEART\nAnonymous -- Found tucked between volumes in the Zoological Wing\n\nShe catalogued every species but could not classify what she felt when he entered the archive.\n\nMiravel had indexed 14,237 species across six continents. She could identify any bird by its call, any tree by its bark, any fish by the pattern of its scales. Classification was not merely her profession -- it was her way of understanding the world. Everything had a place. Everything had a name. Everything fit somewhere in the great taxonomy of existence.\n\nExcept Caelen.\n\nHe was a restoration specialist, assigned to repair water-damaged manuscripts in the western archive. His hands were always stained with the pigments he used to reconstruct faded illustrations. He hummed while he worked -- quietly, absently, melodies that Miravel did not recognize and that seemed to have no pattern she could identify.\n\nShe first noticed him when he brought a restored botanical plate to her division for verification. The illustration depicted a flowering vine that had been extinct for two centuries. His restoration was flawless. Every petal precise. Every leaf vein accurately rendered.\n\n\'The original artist used a stippling technique,\' he said, pointing to the petals. \'See how the color builds in layers? Most restorers would simply fill the gaps. But the technique IS the record. Lose the technique and you lose something the species meant.\'\n\nShe stared at him. In three hundred years of working with restoration specialists, none had ever spoken about technique as though it contained meaning beyond function.\n\n\'You understand,\' she said, before she could stop herself.\n\n\'Understand what?\'\n\n\'That the record is not just information. It is... texture. Context. The way a thing was seen, not just what was seen.\'\n\nHe smiled. It was a small smile, tentative, the smile of someone who had offered a private thought and been surprised to find it received.\n\n\'Exactly,\' he said.\n\nShe began visiting the restoration wing. Professional curiosity, she told herself. She wanted to ensure the botanical plates were being handled correctly. The fact that she had never inspected the restoration wing in three centuries of work was, she decided, an oversight she was simply correcting.\n\nHe showed her his techniques. The way he mixed pigments from natural sources to match the original palettes. The way he held his brush -- not like a tool but like an extension of his hand, the bristles moving with the same delicacy he applied to everything. She watched his hands and felt something she could not name.\n\nShe tried to classify it. Admiration? She admired many colleagues without this accompanying tightness in her chest. Intellectual attraction? She had experienced that before -- the pleasure of a keen mind -- and it had never made her forget what she was saying mid-sentence.\n\nWeeks became months. Months became years. She found reasons to visit the restoration wing daily. He found reasons to bring manuscripts to her division for consultation. Neither acknowledged what was happening. Elves are patient. Elves are careful. Elves do not name things until they are certain, because names have weight, and weight has consequences.\n\nOne afternoon, he was restoring an illustration of a mated pair of cranes -- a species extinct since the War. The cranes stood with their necks intertwined, a posture Miravel knew indicated lifelong pair bonding.\n\n\'They mated for life,\' she said, watching him paint.\n\n\'I know,\' he said. Then, without looking up from his work: \'Miravel. I am going to say something, and I would like you to not classify it until I am finished.\'\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\'I have looked forward to your visits every day for eleven years. I arrange my schedule around them. I have restored forty-seven botanical plates that did not require restoration because bringing them to you was the only excuse I could manufacture. I believe what I feel for you is the thing that those cranes understood and that the archive cannot contain in any volume, and I am telling you because another century of silence would be a waste of the time that even elves should not squander.\'\n\nHe looked up. His eyes were steady. His stained hands were still.\n\nShe opened her mouth. Closed it. Opened it again.\n\n\'I have been trying to classify this for eleven years,\' she said. \'I cannot. It does not fit. It is the only thing in my career that does not fit.\'\n\n\'Is that a problem?\'\n\n\'No,\' she said, and was surprised by her own certainty. \'I think it is the answer.\'\n\nHe set down his brush. She took his stained hand in hers. The cranes watched from the page, their necks still intertwined, patient as only the recorded dead can be.'

    content: 'A BREACH OF PROTOCOL\nArchive Entry -- Sealed, Classification Restricted\n\nCouncil members do not fraternize. This was policy. This was law. This was entirely ignored after midnight.\n\nThe Elven High Council convened four times per year, each session lasting exactly thirty days. Twelve members. Twelve perspectives. Twelve voices that shaped the future of a civilization that measured its history in millennia. The sessions were exhausting, contentious, and governed by a protocol document that was itself seven hundred years old and contained 4,312 rules.\n\nRule 1,847: Council members shall maintain professional detachment from one another at all times. Personal relationships compromise deliberative integrity.\n\nCouncillor Vaelith had served for ninety years. She represented the Archive Division -- quiet, meticulous, devastating in debate when she chose to engage. Her arguments were constructed like architecture: every point load-bearing, every concession structural, every conclusion inevitable.\n\nCouncillor Erevan had served for sixty years. He represented the Forest Wardens -- passionate by elven standards, which meant he occasionally raised his voice above conversational volume. He argued from instinct as often as from evidence, which drove the rest of the council to distraction and, occasionally, to revelation.\n\nThey disagreed on everything. Vaelith favored preservation. Erevan favored adaptation. She cited precedent. He cited necessity. She built frameworks. He dismantled them and asked what remained. Their debates dominated council sessions and produced, over decades, some of the most consequential policy decisions in recent elven history.\n\nWhat the other ten council members did not know was that these debates continued past midnight, in the corridor outside the council chamber, where the torches burned low and the protocol document held no jurisdiction.\n\nIt began in the forty-third year of their overlap. A particularly brutal session on forest management policy had ended with neither yielding. They had both remained in the chamber after the others left, organizing their notes in silence, until Vaelith said: \'Your argument about adaptive resilience had merit. I did not concede because the precedent implications were unacceptable. But the argument had merit.\'\n\nErevan looked at her. In forty-three years, she had never acknowledged the merit of an argument she had formally opposed.\n\n\'Thank you,\' he said.\n\n\'It was not a compliment. It was an observation.\'\n\n\'With you, those are the same thing.\'\n\nShe almost smiled. He saw it -- the corner of her mouth, the slight shift in her expression that on a human face would have been invisible but on an elven face, trained for centuries in composure, was the equivalent of a shout.\n\nThey began meeting in the corridor after sessions. At first to continue debates. Then to discuss matters unrelated to council business. Then to simply stand in one another\'s presence, which for two elves who had spent decades in formal opposition was a more intimate act than either had anticipated.\n\n\'This is a breach of protocol,\' she said one night, six months into their corridor meetings. \'Rule 1,847.\'\n\n\'I am aware of the rule.\'\n\n\'If the council discovers this, our impartiality will be questioned. Every vote we have cast could be reviewed.\'\n\n\'We have never once voted the same way on anything,\' he pointed out.\n\n\'That is not the point.\'\n\n\'It is exactly the point. We are not compromised. We simply... continue our work in an unofficial setting.\'\n\n\'That is the most elegant rationalization I have ever heard.\'\n\n\'I learned from the best.\'\n\nTwenty years passed. They met in the corridor. They argued. They agreed. They stood in silence. He brought tea, sometimes, brewed from forest herbs that he gathered himself. She brought archived poetry that she read aloud, her voice precise and measured, while he listened with an attention he gave to nothing else.\n\nOn a night in the seventy-first year of their overlap, she set down the poetry and said: \'Erevan. I believe I have developed an attachment to you that Rule 1,847 was specifically designed to prevent.\'\n\n\'I developed that attachment forty years ago,\' he said.\n\n\'You might have mentioned it.\'\n\n\'You are the expert on protocol. I was waiting for you to establish the framework.\'\n\nShe looked at him. He looked at her. The torches burned low. Somewhere in the archive, the protocol document sat on its shelf, its 4,312 rules undisturbed.\n\n\'The framework,\' she said carefully, \'is this: we are two people who have spent seventy years pretending that what we do in this corridor is professional discourse. It is not. It has not been for some time. I propose that we stop pretending.\'\n\n\'Seconded,\' he said.\n\n\'The motion carries.\'\n\nHe kissed her in the corridor, by the light of the last torch, and Rule 1,847 was not amended, because amending it would have required acknowledging it had been broken, and some things the council did not need to know.'

    content: 'RIDERS BENEATH THE SAME SKY\nTold by Elder Rashka of the Wind-Scarred Clan\n\nShe challenged him to single combat. He yielded deliberately. She punched him. Then she kissed him.\n\nThis is the story of Keva and Drog, and it is told at every bonfire because it makes the young ones laugh and the old ones remember.\n\nKeva was outrider for the Storm-Born clan. Best rider on the steppe. Could shoot a hare from horseback at full gallop. Could read weather three days out by the taste of the wind. Fierce in the way that matters -- not loud, not boastful, but utterly certain. When Keva said the river would flood, you moved camp. When Keva said the pass was clear, you rode without scouting. She was not wrong. She was never wrong.\n\nDrog was outrider for the Iron-Tooth clan. Second best rider on the steppe, which bothered him not at all because first place belonged to Keva and losing to Keva was not losing -- it was education. He was big even by orcish standards, broad across the shoulders, with a laugh that carried across valleys and hands that could gentle a panicked horse or break a man\'s jaw with equal ease.\n\nThe clans met at the autumn gathering, as they did every year. There were races and contests and, on the third night, the challenge ring -- where any orc could challenge any other to single combat for honor, for dispute resolution, or for the simple pleasure of testing yourself against someone worthy.\n\nKeva entered the ring and called Drog\'s name.\n\nThe clans went quiet. A cross-clan challenge was serious. It could mean blood grievance. It could mean territorial dispute. It could mean war.\n\nDrog entered the ring. He looked at Keva. She was half his weight, a head shorter, and vibrating with an intensity that had nothing to do with anger.\n\n\'What is your grievance?\' the elder asked.\n\n\'No grievance,\' Keva said. \'I want to see what he is made of.\'\n\nThe elder nodded. A testing challenge. Legitimate. The clans settled in to watch.\n\nThey circled. Keva was fast -- striking twice before Drog could set his stance. She hit him in the ribs and the shoulder and danced back before he could grab her. He grinned. Not mocking. Delighted. The way a rider grins when the horse beneath him finds another gear.\n\nShe came again. He blocked the first strike, absorbed the second, and caught her wrist on the third. He could have thrown her. He could have pinned her. He was twice her weight and his grip was iron.\n\nHe let go.\n\nShe stared at him. \'You yielded.\'\n\n\'I did.\'\n\n\'I did not come here for a gift. I came here for a fight.\'\n\n\'I know,\' he said. \'But if I throw you, I win a fight. If I yield, I win something else.\'\n\n\'What?\'\n\n\'The chance to say that I would rather stand beside you than against you. And I would rather you hear that while you are still angry enough to respect it.\'\n\nShe punched him. Full force, square in the jaw. His head snapped back and blood bloomed on his lip and he did not stop grinning.\n\nThen she grabbed his collar and kissed him, hard, in front of both clans, and the bonfire roared and the elders laughed and the young riders whooped because they had come to see a fight and they got something better.\n\nThe clans allied the following spring. Keva and Drog rode together for thirty-one years after that. Best outriders on the steppe. They argued constantly -- about routes, about weather, about whose horse was faster. They never argued about what mattered.\n\nWhen Drog died -- a winter fever, not a blade, which offended him greatly -- Keva rode alone for one year. Then she trained the next generation of outriders for both clans, and she was fierce and certain and never wrong.\n\nAt bonfires, when the young ones ask what love looks like among orcs, the elders tell this story. It looks like a punch and a kiss and thirty-one years of riding the same steppe beneath the same sky.\n\nIt looks like choosing to stand beside.'

    content: 'THE LAW DOES NOT FORBID THIS\nTold by Elder Ghatuk of the Red Dust Clan\n\nThey searched the entire legal code. Nowhere did it say a warband leader could not love another warband leader.\n\nThe orcish legal code is not a book. It is a memory, passed from elder to elder, recited in full at the winter solstice, and it covers everything from grazing rights to blood debt to the proper way to divide a slain beast among the hunters. It has been refined over centuries. It is comprehensive. It is specific. It addresses situations that most civilizations would never think to codify.\n\nIt says nothing about this.\n\nSulga led the eastern warband of the Red Dust clan. Forty riders. Her warband held the eastern border against imperial patrols, bandit raiders, and the occasional territorial dispute with neighboring clans. She had led them for twelve years without losing a single rider to anything except old age and one very stubborn horse.\n\nVoshka led the western warband. Forty-two riders. Her warband held the western passes, guarding the trade routes that kept the clan fed during lean winters. She had led for nine years and had a reputation for strategy so patient that enemies often surrendered out of sheer boredom.\n\nThey met twice a year at the clan moot, where warband leaders reported to the elders and coordinated for the coming season. For the first five years, their interactions were professional. Clipped reports. Tactical assessments. Acknowledgments of shared resources.\n\nIn the sixth year, Sulga lingered after the moot. Voshka was still organizing her patrol maps -- hand-drawn on cured leather, meticulous and beautiful in a way that surprised Sulga.\n\n\'Your maps are better than ours,\' Sulga said. It was the first personal thing she had ever said to Voshka.\n\n\'Maps keep riders alive,\' Voshka replied. \'I draw them well because the alternative is drawing them poorly and burying someone.\'\n\n\'That is the most practical reason I have ever heard for artistry.\'\n\nVoshka looked up. \'Artistry?\'\n\n\'Your shading technique on the mountain passes. The way you mark water sources with different symbols for seasonal and permanent. That is not just cartography. That is care.\'\n\nVoshka was quiet for a moment. Then: \'Nobody has ever looked at my maps closely enough to notice the shading.\'\n\n\'I am looking now.\'\n\nThey began exchanging messages between moots. Practical at first -- intelligence on imperial movements, water source updates, game migration patterns. Then the messages grew longer. Voshka described the western sunsets in language that was not remotely tactical. Sulga described the sound of the eastern wind through canyon walls in terms that no military report required.\n\nAt the eighth moot, they walked together after the council fire. They did not touch. They did not need to. Walking together was enough. Among orcs, choosing to be near someone when you could be anywhere else is a statement that requires no words.\n\nThe elders noticed. Of course they did. Elders always notice.\n\nElder Ghatuk consulted the legal code. She recited the relevant sections on warband leadership, on personal conduct, on conflicts of interest that might compromise tactical decisions. She searched for three days.\n\n\'The law does not forbid this,\' she announced at the next council fire.\n\n\'Does the law address it at all?\' asked another elder.\n\n\'No. It genuinely never came up.\'\n\nThere was a long silence. Then Sulga, who was not given to speeches, stood and said: \'We lead on opposite ends of the territory. Our warbands never operate jointly. There is no tactical conflict. What we do when the work is done is our own.\'\n\nVoshka stood beside her. \'What she said.\'\n\nThe elders deliberated for one hour. They emerged and added a single line to the legal code, the first addition in eleven years: \'Warband leaders may form personal bonds provided tactical independence is maintained. The clan\'s defense comes first. The heart comes after.\'\n\nSulga and Voshka maintained their separate commands for twenty-three more years. They met at moots, and between moots when the patrols allowed, and they exchanged messages carried by the fastest riders because even love letters deserve urgency.\n\nWhen they retired from warband leadership, they rode together into the eastern hills and built a camp overlooking the steppe, where they could see both borders from the same fire.\n\nThe law did not forbid it. The heart did not wait for permission.'

    content: 'TWO HORSES, ONE ROAD\nTold by Elder Marveen of the Ash-Walker Clan\n\nEvery spring, the routes crossed at the river. Every spring, for forty years, they had three days.\n\nBruga rode the northern circuit. Twelve hundred miles, from the winter camps through the mountain passes to the spring grazing lands and back. Her clan had ridden this route since before the War, following grass and water and the ancient memory of the land.\n\nHalvir rode the southern circuit. Nine hundred miles, through the dry hills and the canyon country to the coastal trades and back. His clan followed a different rhythm -- not grass but commerce, trading steppe goods for salt and iron and the coastal medicines that kept the herds healthy.\n\nBoth circuits crossed the River Kethag in the first week of spring. Always had. The ford was the only crossing for sixty miles in either direction, and both clans had used it since before anyone could remember.\n\nBruga first saw Halvir when she was nineteen and he was twenty-two. Her clan arrived at the ford on a Tuesday. His arrived on a Wednesday. For three days, while the herds rested and the riders resupplied, the two clans shared the riverbank.\n\nHe was watering his horse downstream when she rode up. He looked at her. She looked at him. Neither spoke. Among orcs, the first look says more than the first word ever could.\n\n\'Your horse is lame,\' she said finally, because she had noticed the slight favoring of the left foreleg and silence was becoming difficult.\n\n\'I know,\' he said. \'Stone bruise. Three days ago.\'\n\n\'I have a poultice.\'\n\n\'I would be grateful.\'\n\nShe treated his horse. He built a fire. They sat beside it and talked until the stars came out, and they talked about nothing important -- routes and weather and the quality of the spring grass -- and everything they said was important because it was the first conversation of the first night of the first spring.\n\nThree days. Then the clans moved on. Different directions. Different circuits. Twelve hundred miles north. Nine hundred miles south. A year between them.\n\nThe second spring, he arrived at the ford a day early. She noticed. She did not say anything. They spent three days talking. When the clans separated, she rode north with a tightness in her chest that she did not examine because examining it would not change the distance.\n\nThe third spring. The fifth. The tenth. Every year, the river. Every year, three days. They learned each other in fragments -- a conversation here, a shared fire there, a silence that grew more comfortable with each passing year until it felt less like absence and more like presence.\n\nIn the fifteenth spring, she said: \'I wait for this. All year. Through the passes and the storms and the calving season. I wait for three days at a river.\'\n\n\'So do I,\' he said.\n\n\'Is three days enough?\'\n\n\'No,\' he said. \'But our clans ride different roads. I cannot leave mine. You cannot leave yours. This is what we have.\'\n\n\'Then we make it enough.\'\n\nThey made it enough. For forty years, they made three days enough. They told each other everything during those days -- every birth and death in their clans, every good season and bad, every thought that had accumulated during the long months apart. They compressed a year of living into seventy-two hours, and those hours were so full that they bent under the weight of everything they held.\n\nIn the thirty-second spring, he arrived limping. An old injury, aggravated by the winter ride. She wrapped his knee and said nothing about the gray in his hair because there was gray in hers too, and time does not require commentary.\n\nIn the thirty-eighth spring, she arrived with a cough that would not clear. He brewed the coastal medicine he carried for the herds and adjusted the dosage for her weight and made her drink it three times a day for three days, and she complained that it tasted like saddle leather, and he said saddle leather had never killed anyone, and she laughed, and the cough eased.\n\nIn the fortieth spring, she arrived at the ford and he was already there. He had come three days early. He looked old. She looked old. They looked at each other across the river and forty years folded into a single moment.\n\n\'I told my clan I am not riding back,\' he said.\n\n\'I told mine the same.\'\n\nThey camped at the ford. They did not ride north or south. They stayed at the river where they had met forty springs ago, and the herds crossed without them, and the circuits continued without them, and the world went on.\n\nThey had more than three days, finally. They had whatever was left.\n\nIt was enough.'

    content: 'THE GAMBLER\'S TELL\nFamily Tradition -- Passed through the Sandwalker Caravan Line\n\nShe could read any face at the card table. But when he smiled at her, she could read nothing except the racing of her own heart.\n\nZari had learned cards before she learned to read. Her mother dealt hands in the back of the wagon while the caravan crossed the dunes, teaching her daughter the language of faces -- the twitch of an ear that meant a strong hand, the stillness of a tail that meant a bluff, the dilation of pupils that meant fear or excitement or both. By the time Zari was fourteen, she could clean out any table in any town along the southern trade road.\n\nShe was not a cheat. She was worse. She was observant.\n\n\'Cards are not about the cards,\' her mother said. \'Cards are about the people holding them. Learn the people and the cards do not matter.\'\n\nZari learned the people. She learned them so well that by twenty she was banned from three taverns, legendary in two caravan circuits, and quietly wealthy in the way that Cat Folk are quietly wealthy -- no property, no vaults, just a saddlebag of coins and the knowledge that she could fill it again at any table.\n\nShe met Tarik in a town called Dust Basin, at a table in the back of a tavern that smelled like lamp oil and bad decisions. He was already seated when she arrived -- a Cat Folk with sand-colored fur and amber eyes and a stillness about him that she found immediately suspicious. Still people were either monks or professionals, and monks did not play cards in Dust Basin.\n\nShe sat down. She bought in. She watched.\n\nHe was good. Not flashy -- his betting patterns were conservative, almost boring. But he won. Consistently. Not large pots. Small, steady wins that accumulated like sand in a boot -- unnoticed until you tried to walk.\n\nShe watched his face. Nothing. No tells. No twitches. No ear movement. No tail signal. His expression was pleasant and empty, like a wall with a nice painting on it. She could read everyone else at the table -- the human merchant bluffing with a pair of threes, the dwarf holding back a full house, the nervous goblin who should not have been playing at all. But Tarik was a closed book in a language she did not speak.\n\nShe lost. Not much. But she lost, and she did not lose, and the novelty of it was so startling that she forgot to be angry.\n\n\'How?\' she asked, after the table cleared and they were the only two remaining.\n\n\'How what?\'\n\n\'I cannot read you. I can read everyone. I cannot read you.\'\n\nHe smiled. And when he smiled, something happened to Zari\'s chest -- a constriction, a warmth, a sensation entirely outside her catalogue of human reactions -- and she realized with a shock that she had spent so long reading other people that she had never learned to read herself.\n\n\'You read faces,\' he said. \'I read patterns. Different skill. Same table.\'\n\n\'Patterns?\'\n\n\'Betting patterns. Timing patterns. The rhythm of how people play, not how they look while playing. You watched my face. You should have watched my chips.\'\n\nShe looked at his chip stack. She replayed the evening in her mind. He was right. His tells were not physical. They were mathematical. And she had been so focused on the surface that she had missed the structure underneath.\n\n\'Play again tomorrow?\' he asked.\n\n\'Yes.\'\n\nThey played again. And again. For five nights in Dust Basin, they sat across from each other, and she learned his patterns while he learned her tells, and slowly, over hands of cards and cups of tea, they disassembled each other\'s defenses with the careful precision of two people who understood that vulnerability was the highest stake either of them had ever played.\n\nOn the sixth night, she did not go to the tavern. She went to the stable where his caravan was camped and said: \'I can read your patterns now.\'\n\n\'And?\'\n\n\'Your patterns say you are going to leave tomorrow. Your caravan heads west. Mine heads east.\'\n\n\'That is correct.\'\n\n\'I do not want you to leave.\'\n\nHe was quiet for a moment. Then he smiled again, and her heart raced again, and she accepted that this was a tell she would never learn to hide.\n\n\'Caravans cross,\' he said. \'Roads meet. I will find your table again.\'\n\n\'Promise?\'\n\n\'I am a gambler. I do not promise. But I will bet everything I have on it.\'\n\nHe found her table again. Three months later, in a town two hundred miles south. And again after that. And again. They played cards and they talked and they learned each other the way only two readers can -- completely, fearlessly, with the understanding that being known is the only prize worth winning.\n\nEventually, the caravans merged. Not formally -- Cat Folk do not do things formally. They simply started traveling the same road. And at the card table, they sat on the same side.'

    content: 'ROADS THAT CROSS\nFamily Tradition -- Told among the Dune-Runner and Starlight Caravans\n\nTwo caravans, decades of rivalry. Their parents forbade them from speaking. So they learned to speak with glances.\n\nThe Dune-Runners and the Starlight caravan had disputed the southern trade route for three generations. Not violently -- Cat Folk do not war among themselves. But with the cold, precise hostility of rival merchants who compete for the same customers in the same towns along the same dusty road. They undercut each other\'s prices. They spread rumors about each other\'s goods. They arrived at market towns a day early to claim the best stalls.\n\nNasha was born to the Dune-Runners. Kael was born to the Starlight caravan. They first saw each other at the age of eight, when both caravans happened to camp at the same oasis. Their parents pulled them apart before they could exchange a word.\n\n\'We do not speak to Starlight Folk,\' Nasha\'s mother said.\n\n\'We do not speak to Dune-Runners,\' Kael\'s father said.\n\nSo they did not speak. But they looked.\n\nAt nine, at the same oasis, he caught her eye across the water and raised one ear -- the Cat Folk gesture for greeting. She raised one ear back. Their parents did not notice.\n\nAt twelve, she held up a desert flower she had found -- white petals, rare in the dunes. He held up a stone, polished smooth by the sand. They showed each other their treasures from fifty yards away, separated by water and history and the stubbornness of adults.\n\nAt fifteen, the gestures grew complex. A tilt of the head: are you well? A slow blink: I am. A flick of the tail: I have something to tell you. A raised paw: I am listening.\n\nThey built a language. Not words -- the distance was too great and the parents too watchful. But a vocabulary of movement, of posture, of expression, that carried meaning across the space between caravans. It was clumsy at first. A raised ear could mean greeting or question or surprise. A tail flick could mean excitement or nervousness or simply that there were flies.\n\nBut they refined it. Year after year, oasis after oasis, they added nuance. By eighteen, Nasha could tell Kael about her day in a sequence of gestures that took thirty seconds. By twenty, he could make her laugh from across the water with a pantomime so subtle that only she could read it.\n\nAt twenty-two, she told him something new. She placed her hand over her heart and then extended it toward him, palm open. He had not seen this gesture before. But he understood it immediately, because some things do not require a shared vocabulary.\n\nHe placed his hand over his own heart. Extended it toward her. Palm open.\n\nTheir parents noticed that one.\n\n\'This ends now,\' Nasha\'s mother said.\n\n\'This will not end,\' Nasha replied. \'You can choose which roads we travel. You cannot choose where I look.\'\n\nHer mother did not speak to her for a week. Then, on the seventh day, she said: \'You are your father\'s daughter. He was stubborn too. It is why I married him.\'\n\nThe caravans met again that autumn. This time, for the first time in twenty-two years, Nasha crossed the water. She walked to Kael\'s side of the oasis, in full view of both caravans, and she spoke to him. Words. Actual words, after a lifetime of gestures.\n\n\'Hello,\' she said.\n\n\'Hello,\' he said. His voice was deeper than she had imagined. She had imagined it many times.\n\n\'I am Nasha.\'\n\n\'I know. I have known for fourteen years.\'\n\n\'I know. I just wanted to hear you say it.\'\n\nBoth caravans watched. Nobody intervened. Some silences, once broken, cannot be restored.\n\nThe rivalry did not end. The Dune-Runners and the Starlight caravan still competed for the same trade routes, still undercut each other\'s prices, still raced to market towns. But Nasha and Kael walked between the caravans at every meeting, and their children -- when they came -- learned both the language of words and the language of glances.\n\nAnd at oases, when the two caravans camped on opposite sides of the water, Nasha and Kael still spoke in gestures across the distance. Not because they had to. Because it was theirs. The first language. The private one. The one that no rivalry could touch.'

Things that mattered on the road.\n\nShe ran the table from a cushion in the back of her wagon, and her rules were absolute. You played fair or you did not play. You honored your debts or you were banned. And you did not ask Mirren personal questions, because Mirren\'s personal life was not on the table.\n\nNobody knew her family name. Nobody knew which caravan she had been born to. Nobody knew why she traveled alone, which was unusual for Cat Folk, who were communal by nature and suspicious by necessity. She was Mirren. She dealt cards. That was enough.\n\nJorik joined the caravan at the spring trade fair. A young Cat Folk with russet fur and an easy manner and the kind of confidence that came either from genuine ability or spectacular ignorance. He sat down at Mirren\'s table on his second evening and played adequately -- not brilliantly, but well enough to suggest he had sat at tables before.\n\nHe lost a night\'s watch duty. He lost first pick of water rations. He accepted both debts without complaint and came back the next evening.\n\n\'You are persistent,\' Mirren observed.\n\n\'I am learning.\'\n\n\'What are you learning?\'\n\n\'Your shuffle pattern. The way you deal -- slightly to the left, which means you are right-handed but trained by someone left-handed. The way you touch the edge of a card before you play it, not to mark it but to feel its weight, which means you learned on a heavier deck. Old cards. Handmade, probably.\'\n\nMirren looked at him with new attention. Nobody analyzed her. She was the one who analyzed.\n\n\'You are observant,\' she said.\n\n\'Only when something is worth observing.\'\n\nHe came back every evening for two weeks. He won sometimes. He lost more often. He never complained and he never boasted and he studied Mirren with the same quiet intensity that she studied everyone else, and she found this simultaneously irritating and electrifying.\n\nOn the fifteenth evening, after the other players had left, he remained at the table.\n\n\'One more hand,\' he said.\n\n\'The table is closed.\'\n\n\'One hand. My stake: everything I own. My pack, my horse, my trade goods, three months of earnings. Everything.\'\n\nShe raised an eyebrow. \'And what do you want if you win?\'\n\n\'The right to ask you your name. Your real name. The one you do not tell anyone.\'\n\nShe stared at him. In four years of running this table, no one had ever wagered for something personal. No one had dared.\n\n\'And if you lose?\'\n\n\'Then I own nothing and I leave the caravan in the morning with what I am wearing. And I never sit at your table again.\'\n\nShe should have said no. The wager was absurd. A name was not a prize. But he sat across from her with amber eyes that held no bluff and no calculation, only the naked certainty of someone who had decided that some things were worth everything, and she dealt the cards because refusing would have been the cowardice she despised in others.\n\nShe won. Of course she won. She always won. The hand was not close.\n\nHe looked at the cards. He looked at her. He nodded.\n\n\'Fair game,\' he said. He stood. He began to remove his belt pouch.\n\n\'Stop,\' she said.\n\nHe stopped.\n\n\'Sit down.\'\n\nHe sat.\n\nShe gathered the cards. She squared the deck. She set it aside. Then she leaned forward, across the table, close enough that he could see the gold flecks in her green eyes.\n\n\'Mirren Ashfall,\' she said quietly. \'Born to the Ghost Dune caravan, which dissolved when I was sixteen. I travel alone because I have not found a reason to stop. My mother was left-handed. She carved the deck I learned on from desert wood, and the cards were heavy because she believed that weight taught respect.\'\n\nHe did not speak. He barely breathed.\n\n\'You lost the hand,\' she said. \'You do not get to ask. But I am choosing to answer. There is a difference.\'\n\n\'Why?\'\n\n\'Because you bet everything. Not for gold. Not for favors. For the right to know me. No one has ever thought that was worth the wager.\'\n\nHe reached across the table. She let him take her hand. His fingers were warm against hers.\n\n\'Keep your things,\' she said. \'Stay at the table.\'\n\n\'Which table?\'\n\n\'Both of them.\'\n\nHe stayed. At the card table, where he never did learn to beat her, and at the other table -- the one with two chairs and two cups and a deck of heavy desert-wood cards between them, where the stakes were honesty and the only winning hand was the one you played together.'

    content: 'EFFICIENCY OF THE HEART\nCitizen 3-4412 -- Personal Record, Not Filed\n\nThe council assigned them as partners. Purely practical. Neither could explain why they lingered after shifts ended.\n\nAssignment Notice 847-2291: Citizen 3-4412 (Geothermal Calibration) is partnered with Citizen 5-1108 (Crystal Resonance Tuning) for the duration of Project Deep-Tap-7. Duration: estimated 14 months. Workspace: Sub-Level 3, Chamber 19.\n\nThat was how it began. A notice. A number. A shared workspace fourteen levels below the surface, where the stone was warm and the air hummed with the deep vibration of the planet\'s core.\n\nCitizen 3-4412 -- Lenn, though the collective did not use first names in official capacity -- had worked alone for eleven years. Geothermal calibration was solitary work. You monitored temperatures. You adjusted flow valves. You recorded data. The stone spoke to you in gradients and pressure differentials, and you listened, and you responded, and at the end of the shift you filed your readings and went to the communal dining hall and ate alone because geothermal specialists tended toward quiet and the dining hall was not.\n\nCitizen 5-1108 -- Vessa -- was his opposite in every measurable parameter. Crystal resonance tuners worked in teams. They talked constantly, comparing frequencies, debating harmonic alignments, arguing about whether a particular crystal\'s output was 0.003 hertz above or below optimal. Vessa talked the way she worked: precisely, rapidly, with a confidence that suggested she had never once doubted that her voice was worth hearing.\n\nOn the first day of the partnership, she arrived at Chamber 19 with three crates of equipment, a resonance scope that she assembled in four minutes, and a thermos of tea.\n\n\'I brought two cups,\' she said. \'The assignment notice said partner. Partners share tea. This is efficient.\'\n\nHe stared at her. Nobody had ever brought him tea.\n\n\'Thank you,\' he said, and drank the tea, and it was too sweet, and he did not mention this because she had brought two cups and the gesture was worth more than the flavor.\n\nThey worked well together. Her crystals needed stable thermal environments; his calibration work provided exactly that. She tuned while he monitored, and the work fell into a rhythm that neither had anticipated -- her voice calling out frequencies, his hands adjusting valves, the chamber filling with a hum that was half geothermal and half crystalline and entirely theirs.\n\nThe shifts were eight hours. They stayed for ten. Then eleven. Then twelve.\n\n\'We are exceeding our assigned hours,\' Lenn said one evening, when they had been working for thirteen hours and neither had mentioned stopping.\n\n\'The work requires it,\' Vessa said.\n\n\'The work was complete two hours ago.\'\n\nShe looked at him. He looked at her. The chamber hummed.\n\n\'Yes,\' she admitted. \'It was.\'\n\nThey sat in the completed silence of a job well done, drinking tea that was too sweet, and neither moved to leave.\n\n\'This is inefficient,\' she said, but she was smiling, and gnomes smile rarely and mean it always.\n\n\'Extremely,\' he agreed.\n\n\'The council would note the wasted hours.\'\n\n\'They would. But the council is not here.\'\n\nThe project was scheduled for fourteen months. It ran for sixteen, because both partners filed extension requests citing the need for additional calibration that neither could quite specify. The council approved the extensions without comment. Councils, even gnomish ones, are not entirely blind.\n\nWhen Project Deep-Tap-7 concluded, they filed a joint request for reassignment to the same division. Then a joint request for adjacent quarters. Then a joint request for a shared workspace, citing the efficiency gains demonstrated during their partnership.\n\nThe council approved all three requests. The efficiency gains were real. But efficiency was not why they had asked, and everyone involved knew it, and nobody said so, because some things the collective allows to exist without classification.\n\nLenn still drank tea that was too sweet. He never mentioned it. Some inefficiencies are worth preserving.'

The first three versions were too long. This version may also be too long but I am sending it regardless because it is 23:47 and I cannot sleep and the reason I cannot sleep is that you smiled at me during the shift change today and I have been thinking about it for seven hours.\n\nThis is not efficient. Thinking about a smile for seven hours produces no measurable output. I am aware of this. I have calculated it. Seven hours times my standard productivity rate equals approximately 3.2 lens assemblies that I did not complete. The collective has lost 3.2 lens assemblies because you smiled at me.\n\nI do not know what to do with this information.\n\nWe have been partners on the Lighthouse Lens project for nine months. In that time I have observed the following: you arrive at the workshop seven minutes before your shift begins. You organize your tools in the same order every morning -- calipers, files, mounting brackets, adhesive. You hum when you concentrate. You do not realize you hum when you concentrate. The melody is always the same and I have transcribed it and it does not correspond to any known composition. It is yours. You invented it without knowing you invented it.\n\nI know these things because I have been watching you for nine months, and I have been pretending that I watch you because our work requires coordination, and our work does require coordination, but that is not why I watch you.\n\nYesterday I submitted Form WA-7 to the Workshop Assignment Bureau requesting extension of our partnership for an additional project cycle. Reason given: demonstrated efficiency gains in cross-section collaboration. This reason is true. It is also incomplete.\n\nToday, during shift change, Coordinator Pell informed me that you had submitted the same form. Same request. Same reason. Same day.\n\nThe council noted the redundancy. Coordinator Pell said this with an expression that I believe the surface peoples would call a "smirk." I do not know what to do with that information either.\n\nI am writing to you at 23:47 because I have spent nine months being efficient and professional and appropriately collaborative and it has cost me approximately 847 hours of sleep and an unknown quantity of lens assemblies and I have reached the conclusion that efficiency is not always the correct optimization target.\n\nYou smiled at me. I would like to know if you smiled at me for the same reason I could not stop thinking about it.\n\nIf I am wrong, please disregard this message. I will file a retraction with the internal message system and we can continue our professional partnership without disruption.\n\nIf I am not wrong, please meet me in Workshop 14 tomorrow before the shift begins. I will be there at seven minutes before start time. I know you will be too.\n\n-- Citizen 7-0093 (Mira)\n\nRESPONSE:\nFrom: Citizen 2-8847\nTo: Citizen 7-0093\nTimestamp: Year 847, Day 114, 23:52\n\nMira.\n\nI submitted the form three days before you did. I have been watching you for eleven months, which is two months longer than you have been watching me, because I noticed you before the project started, when you delivered a lens calibration report to my section and explained the refraction indices with a passion that made me forget what refraction was.\n\nThe melody I hum is something my mother used to sing. I did not realize I was humming it. The fact that you transcribed it makes me feel something that I cannot quantify and do not wish to.\n\nI will be in Workshop 14 at seven minutes before shift. I am always there at seven minutes before shift.

    content: 'SECTOR 7, WORKSHOP 14\nCitizen 1-2200 -- Found in a sealed toolbox during workshop decommission\n\nThey built automatons together for thirty years. They built something else. Something the council could not classify.\n\nWorkshop 14 in Sector 7 was a small room. Eight meters by six. Two workbenches. One shared tool rack. A ventilation duct that whistled when the wind came from the north. It had been assigned to Automaton Assembly, Minor Repair Division, for longer than anyone currently alive could remember.\n\nHalen arrived first, forty-three years ago. The Workshop Assignment Bureau placed him there because his aptitude scores showed exceptional fine motor skills and a personality profile suited to repetitive precision work. In other words: he was patient and he was good with his hands and he did not mind being alone.\n\nFor thirteen years, he was alone. He repaired automaton joints, replaced worn gears, recalibrated servo mechanisms. The work was quiet. The ventilation duct whistled. He kept his tools in perfect order and his workbench clean and his reports filed on time, and if anyone had asked him whether he was happy -- though gnomes did not typically ask such questions -- he would have said that he was functional, which in the collective was considered sufficient.\n\nThen Sera arrived.\n\nShe was reassigned from Sector 3 due to a restructuring that consolidated minor repair divisions. She was small even by gnomish standards, with steady hands and a habit of talking to the automatons she repaired.\n\n\'The motivator spring is compressed unevenly,\' she said to Unit 4-K-871 on her first day, while Halen watched from his bench. \'No wonder you walk crooked. Someone rushed the last repair. I will not rush.\'\n\n\'The automaton cannot hear you,\' Halen said.\n\n\'I know,\' she replied, without looking up. \'But I can hear myself. And saying it out loud helps me be precise.\'\n\nHe considered this. It was not standard procedure. But it was not forbidden, and after thirteen years of silence, the sound of another voice in Workshop 14 was not unwelcome.\n\nShe talked to the automatons. She talked to the tools. She talked to the ventilation duct. Eventually, inevitably, she talked to Halen.\n\nSmall things at first. Questions about procedure. Comments on shared repair cases. Observations about the weather, which neither of them could see from fourteen levels underground but which both of them tracked through the behavior of the ventilation duct -- high wind meant the whistle pitched up; rain meant condensation on the metal lip; snow meant silence.\n\nOne year became three. Three became ten. Ten became twenty. They developed a working rhythm so precise that they could repair an automaton together without speaking -- she disassembling from the left while he disassembled from the right, their hands moving in counterpoint like the gears they serviced.\n\nThey knew each other the way two instruments in an orchestra know each other: not through words but through timing, through the shared anticipation of what comes next.\n\nIn the twenty-third year, during a difficult repair on a Class 3 industrial frame, he handed her a tool before she asked for it. She looked at the tool. She looked at him.\n\n\'How did you know?\' she asked.\n\n\'The way your left hand positioned. You always reach for the number four file when the gear teeth show that pattern of wear.\'\n\n\'You have memorized my hand positions.\'\n\n\'I have memorized everything about you,\' he said, and then stopped, because the sentence had emerged fully formed from a place he had not known existed, and he had no framework for what to do with it.\n\nThe workshop was very quiet. The ventilation duct whistled.\n\n\'Twenty-three years,\' she said softly. \'I have talked to automatons and tools and ventilation ducts because I was afraid that if I talked to you about the things I actually wanted to say, you would request reassignment.\'\n\n\'I would not have requested reassignment.\'\n\n\'I know that now.\'\n\n\'What did you want to say?\'\n\nShe set down her file. She turned to face him fully, which she had never done -- in twenty-three years of shared space, they had always sat side by side, facing their work. Face to face was different. Face to face was deliberate.\n\n\'That this workshop is eight meters by six and it contains everything I need,\' she said. \'Not the tools. Not the automatons. You. You are what I need. You have been what I need for longer than I knew how to say it, and I am saying it now because thirty years is too long to wait and I will not wait for forty.\'\n\nHe reached across the space between their workbenches. She took his hand. His fingers were calloused from thirty years of gear work. Hers were calloused the same way. They fit together like components designed for the same machine.\n\n\'The council will note this,\' he said.\n\n\'Let them note it.\'\n\n\'They may reassign one of us.\'\n\n\'Then I will file an objection every day until they reassign me back.\'\n\nThe council noted it. They did not reassign either of them. Workshop 14 continued to operate at peak efficiency, and the repair logs showed no decline in output, and the council had enough data to recognize that some partnerships produced results that transcended their productivity metrics.\n\nSeven more years. They worked. They talked. They sat side by side and sometimes face to face, and the ventilation duct whistled, and the automatons came in broken and left repaired, and in the small warm space of Sector 7, Workshop 14, two gnomes who had spent thirty years building machines built something the machines could never replicate.\n\nThe council could not classify it. They did not try. Some outputs do not fit in a report.'

    content: 'THE SONG OF THORNHOLLOW LOVERS\nResistance Archive -- Oral History, Transcribed\n\nBefore the burning, before the flight / Two hearts beat as one in the warren\'s night.\n\nThis is a song before it is a story, and it is a story before it is a history, and it is a history before it is a wound. The elders sing it at the deep fires, when the tunnels are sealed and the sentries are posted and for a few hours the warren pretends the empire does not exist.\n\nPix and Nettla lived in Thornhollow warren, in the years before the Sixth Clearance Campaign. Thornhollow was not large -- perhaps four hundred goblins in the deep chambers, with another hundred in the surface tunnels that served as trading posts and early warning stations. It was hidden in the hills east of the imperial border, beneath a stand of thorn trees so dense that human soldiers could not move through them without bleeding.\n\nPix was a mushroom farmer. He tended the deep gardens where luminescent fungi grew in carefully maintained beds of rotting wood and mineral-rich clay. The work required patience and a gentle touch and the willingness to spend days in the dark, talking to the mushrooms because mushrooms grew better when you talked to them. This was not superstition. This was mycology. The vibrations of a voice stimulated growth. Pix had a good voice -- low and steady and warm -- and his gardens produced twice the yield of anyone else\'s.\n\nNettla was a tunnel singer. In the deep warrens, where no light reached and the passages twisted in patterns designed to confuse intruders, the tunnel singers served as living maps. They sang, and the echoes told them the shape of the space -- the width of a passage, the depth of a chamber, the presence of water or collapse or, worst of all, the hollow silence that meant the empire had breached the outer tunnels.\n\nNettla\'s voice could map a chamber in three notes. She could hear a crack in a support beam from forty meters away. She could distinguish the footsteps of four hundred individual goblins and know each one by name.\n\nShe knew Pix\'s footsteps best. She had been listening for them for three years.\n\nHe came to the deep tunnels every morning to tend his gardens, and every morning she found a reason to be singing in the passages he walked through. She told herself she was mapping. She told herself the tunnels near his gardens needed frequent monitoring. She told herself many things, and her voice, which could detect a crack in stone at forty meters, could not seem to detect the lie in her own reasoning.\n\nHe noticed. Of course he noticed. His gardens were in the quietest section of the warren, and suddenly there was singing nearby every morning, and the singing was beautiful, and he was not stupid.\n\nOne morning, he left a mushroom at the entrance to her passage. A blue luminesce -- the prettiest variety, the one that glowed like captured starlight. He did not attach a note. Goblins did not waste paper on things that did not need explaining.\n\nShe left a song at the entrance to his garden. Not a mapping song -- a melody, something she had composed in the dark hours when the warren slept, something that she had never sung for anyone because it was too personal, too exposed, too much like standing in a chamber without walls.\n\nHe heard it from inside the garden. He set down his tools. He walked to the entrance. She was standing in the passage, singing the last note, and the echo carried it down the tunnel and back again, and for a moment the stone itself seemed to hold the sound.\n\n\'That was not a mapping song,\' he said.\n\n\'No.\'\n\n\'What was it?\'\n\n\'Yours,\' she said. \'I made it for you. I have been making it for three years.\'\n\nHe took her hands. His fingers were stained with soil and mycelium. Hers were calloused from years of pressing them against stone to feel the echoes. They stood in the passage between her tunnels and his garden, in the place where their two worlds overlapped.\n\nThey had four years. Four years of songs in the passage and mushrooms at the entrance and a love that grew in the dark the way everything good in a warren grows in the dark -- quietly, stubbornly, without sunlight or permission.\n\nThen the Sixth Clearance Campaign came. The empire burned the thorn trees. They poured fire into the tunnels. Thornhollow fell in a single night.\n\nPix and Nettla escaped with two hundred others through the deep passages that only a tunnel singer could navigate in total darkness. Nettla sang them out. Three notes to map a chamber. Two notes to find the path. One note, repeated, to tell the children it was safe to keep moving.\n\nThey rebuilt in a new warren, deeper, better hidden. They had nineteen more years together. He farmed mushrooms. She sang tunnels. They raised two children who learned both skills.\n\nWhen the elders sing the Song of Thornhollow Lovers, they sing it in the dark. Because that is where it happened. And because some things can only be heard clearly when you cannot see.\n\nBefore the burning, before the flight.\nTwo hearts beat as one in the warren\'s night.\nHe grew the light beneath the stone.\nShe sang the way to lead them home.'

    content: 'CELL LEADER\'S SECRET\nResistance Archive -- Sealed Record, Declassified\n\nShe led a cell for twenty years. Fearless. Cold as stone. Only one goblin knew otherwise.\n\nVriss led Cell Nine of the Eastern Resistance. Twelve goblins. Operating in imperial territory. Sabotaging supply lines, forging travel documents, smuggling refugees through the border. For twenty years, Cell Nine was the empire\'s most persistent problem in the eastern provinces, and Vriss was the reason.\n\nShe was everything a cell leader needed to be. Calm under pressure. Decisive under fire. Merciless when mercy would cost lives. She once walked into an imperial checkpoint, presented forged papers, and walked out with six goblin prisoners without raising her voice or her pulse. The guards remembered a quiet goblin woman with forgettable features and a merchant\'s license. They did not remember a resistance leader who had just emptied their jail.\n\nHer cell knew her as the Commander. They did not know her name. They did not know where she slept. They did not know anything about her personal life, because personal lives were security vulnerabilities and Vriss did not tolerate vulnerabilities.\n\nOnly Tatch knew.\n\nTatch was her runner -- the goblin who carried messages between Cell Nine and the warren network. Small, fast, unremarkable. The kind of goblin that humans looked past because they expected goblins to be loud and obvious, and Tatch was neither. He had been Vriss\'s runner for fifteen years, which meant he had survived longer than any other runner in the eastern network, which meant he was either very lucky or very good. He was very good.\n\nHe was also the only person who had ever seen Vriss cry.\n\nIt happened in the seventh year of Cell Nine\'s operations. A mission went wrong. An ambush. Two cell members captured. Vriss ordered the cell to retreat and spent three days arranging a rescue that required more precision than any operation she had ever planned.\n\nThe rescue succeeded. Both goblins extracted alive. Cell Nine relocated to a backup site. Vriss debriefed the team, adjusted the security protocols, and dismissed everyone for rest.\n\nTatch lingered. He always lingered. It was not his job. His job was to carry messages and disappear. But he lingered because he had watched Vriss for seven years and he had learned to read the spaces between her words the way he read the spaces between imperial patrols -- carefully, attentively, knowing that what was hidden was more important than what was visible.\n\nHe found her in the back tunnel, sitting against the wall with her arms around her knees, shaking. Not sobbing. Not making any sound at all. Just shaking, the way a person shakes when they have held themselves rigid for too long and the body finally demands its due.\n\nHe sat beside her. He did not speak. He did not touch her. He simply sat, close enough that she could feel his presence, far enough that she could pretend he was not there if she needed to.\n\nShe did not pretend.\n\n\'I almost lost them,\' she whispered. \'Two of my people. Because I did not see the ambush.\'\n\n\'You got them back.\'\n\n\'This time.\'\n\n\'Yes. This time. And next time. And the time after that. Because you are the best cell leader in the eastern network and everyone knows it except you.\'\n\nShe looked at him. In seven years, she had never looked at him directly. He was her runner. Runners were tools. You did not look at tools. You used them.\n\nBut he was sitting beside her in a dark tunnel, and he had seen her break, and he had not flinched, and she looked at him and saw a goblin who had spent seven years being invisible so that she could survive.\n\n\'Why do you stay?\' she asked.\n\n\'Because someone has to know that the Commander is also a person. And because I would rather be here, in a tunnel, watching you shake, than anywhere else in the world. That is either dedication to the cause or something else. I think it is something else.\'\n\nShe did not respond for a long time. The tunnel was dark and close and safe in the way that only underground places are safe -- hidden, enclosed, beyond the reach of light and empire.\n\n\'This is a security vulnerability,\' she said finally.\n\n\'Yes.\'\n\n\'If they take you, they can use you against me.\'\n\n\'They will not take me. I am very good at not being taken.\'\n\n\'And if they do?\'\n\n\'Then I will die before I say your name. Not because I am brave. Because your name is the most valuable thing I carry, and I do not surrender valuable things.\'\n\nShe reached out in the dark and found his hand. Small fingers, calloused from years of climbing and running and gripping message tubes. She held his hand and she stopped shaking.\n\nThirteen more years. The cell operated. The missions continued. Vriss remained the Commander -- fearless, cold, efficient. The cell saw nothing different.\n\nBut in the back tunnels, after debriefings, in the small hours when the watch changed and the warren was quiet, two goblins sat together in the dark. She told him the fears she could not show anyone else. He told her the hope he carried through every run.\n\nThe resistance archived many records. Operations. Intelligence. Casualty lists. But some records were never written down, because some things are safer in the dark where only two people know they exist.\n\nVriss and Tatch. Cell leader and runner. Twenty years. The resistance\'s most closely guarded secret was not a safe house or a smuggling route.\n\nIt was the fact that the Commander had a heart, and someone to hold it.'

    content: 'SECT-FORBIDDEN\nAnonymous -- Found sealed in a clay vessel, submerged\n\nHe served the Astronomers. She served the River Engineers. The sects did not share. But beneath the dunes they shared everything.\n\nThe sects of the Lizard Folk are not castes. This is the first thing outsiders misunderstand. A caste is assigned. A sect is chosen -- or, more precisely, a sect chooses you. The Astronomers observe the stars and calculate the patterns that govern tide and season and the slow precession of celestial bodies. The River Engineers build and maintain the canal systems that sustain life in the desert lowlands. Both are essential. Both are proud. Both guard their knowledge with the ferocity of peoples who understand that knowledge is the only wealth that cannot be stolen at swordpoint.\n\nAnd the sects do not share. Not knowledge. Not resources. Not members. Certainly not hearts.\n\nKethis was inducted into the Astronomers at the age of twelve, when his teachers noticed that he could track the movement of stars with a precision that suggested an innate understanding of celestial geometry. He rose through the ranks -- Initiate, Observer, Calculator, Interpreter. By thirty, he was mapping stellar drift patterns that the sect\'s oldest records had not predicted. By forty, he was one of seven Senior Interpreters entrusted with the Astronomers\' deepest calculations.\n\nShalai was inducted into the River Engineers at the age of ten, when she diverted a flooding canal using nothing but sandbags and an intuitive understanding of fluid dynamics that her instructors called extraordinary. She rose with similar speed -- Apprentice, Builder, Designer, Master. By thirty-five, she was redesigning canal junctions that had not been improved in two centuries.\n\nThey met at the Conjunction Assembly -- the twice-yearly gathering where sect leaders coordinated on matters of shared infrastructure. Astronomers provided tide predictions. River Engineers used those predictions to manage water levels. The exchange was formal, scripted, and conducted through intermediaries to prevent unauthorized knowledge transfer.\n\nKethis was the intermediary for the Astronomers. Shalai was the intermediary for the River Engineers. They stood on opposite sides of a stone table and exchanged sealed data tablets without eye contact, as protocol required.\n\nOn the third exchange, their fingers touched. An accident. A data tablet passed slightly off-center, and for one second, his scales brushed hers, and the thermal sense that all Lizard Folk possess registered the warmth of another body, and something in both of them shifted.\n\nLizard Folk do not blush. They do not stammer. Their emotional responses are internal, invisible, detectable only by other Lizard Folk through the subtle thermal signatures that ripple across their scales. Kethis\'s scales flushed 0.3 degrees warmer on his left hand. Shalai\'s flushed 0.4 degrees on her right.\n\nNeither spoke. Both noticed.\n\nThe meetings continued. Twice a year. Sealed tablets. No eye contact. But the tablets began arriving with small variations -- a calculation annotated with a margin note that was not strictly necessary, a canal specification accompanied by a sketch of the waterway that was more beautiful than engineering required.\n\nMessages hidden inside messages. Art disguised as data. The language of two people who could not speak finding a way to speak anyway.\n\nAfter four years of annotated tablets, Kethis broke protocol. He waited at the exchange site after the assembly ended. Shalai waited too. They stood on opposite sides of the stone table and looked at each other directly for the first time.\n\n\'I annotate the tide predictions with information you do not need,\' he said. \'I do this because the annotations are the only part of the exchange that is mine to give, rather than the sect\'s.\'\n\n\'I know,\' she said. \'I sketch the canals in a style that wastes three hours of drafting time. I do this because I want you to see something I made, not something the sect made.\'\n\n\'This is forbidden.\'\n\n\'Yes.\'\n\n\'What do we do?\'\n\n\'There are places beneath the dunes,\' she said. \'Old cisterns. Abandoned when the canals shifted. The sects do not monitor them because they serve no current function. I can show you.\'\n\nHe followed her. Beneath the dunes, in a cistern that had not held water in a century, they sat in the cool dark and spoke. Not about stars. Not about canals. About themselves. About the lives they lived inside the structures that defined them, and the lives they might live outside those structures, if outside were a place they could reach.\n\nThey met in the cisterns for six years. Twice a year became four times. Four became monthly. They learned each other the way their sects learned the world -- through careful observation, through patient measurement, through the slow accumulation of data points that gradually resolved into a picture too complete to deny.\n\nThe sects never discovered them. The cisterns kept their secret. And beneath the dunes, where no protocols applied and no intermediaries stood between them, two Lizard Folk who had been taught that knowledge must be guarded found that the most important knowledge they possessed was each other.'

    content: 'SIX HUNDRED YEARS\nAnonymous -- Provenance Unknown\n\n\'You cannot understand me,\' he said. \'Then teach me,\' she replied. He spent four hundred years doing exactly that.\n\nVasherak was old even by Lizard Folk standards. Six centuries of life had given him a perspective that most beings could not comprehend -- the ability to see patterns that spanned generations, to remember events that had passed from history into legend into myth and back into history again as scholars rediscovered what time had buried.\n\nHe had watched empires rise. He had watched them fall. He had watched the same mistakes repeated by different peoples wearing different crowns, and he had stopped being surprised by any of it approximately three centuries ago.\n\nTalindra was young. Ninety years old -- barely an adult by the long-lived standards of her people. She was a junior researcher in the Historical Sect, assigned to compile records from the early post-War period. Earnest. Determined. Perpetually frustrated by the gaps in the archive.\n\nShe sought out Vasherak because he had lived through the period she was studying. He was not a record. He was a witness. The difference, she understood, was everything.\n\n\'I have questions about the Treaty of Shallow Waters,\' she said, standing at the entrance to his chamber. \'Year 247. The secondary archive has fragments but no complete account.\'\n\nHe looked at her from across a room filled with six centuries of accumulated belongings -- star charts, water samples, pressed plants, a collection of stones from rivers that no longer existed.\n\n\'The Treaty of Shallow Waters was a mistake,\' he said. \'I was there. I was young. I thought it was a triumph. I was wrong.\'\n\n\'The fragments suggest it prevented a war.\'\n\n\'It delayed a war. Preventing and delaying are not the same, though they feel identical at the time. You cannot understand this. You are ninety. You have not yet seen a delayed consequence arrive.\'\n\n\'Then teach me,\' she said.\n\nHe looked at her for a long time. Ninety years old. The age of certainty, when the world seems knowable and the future seems shapeable and wisdom seems like something you can acquire through study rather than something that settles on you like sediment over centuries.\n\n\'Sit down,\' he said. \'This will take time.\'\n\nIt took time. She came every week. He told her about the Treaty -- not the diplomatic version that the archives recorded but the real version, the one that included the exhaustion and the compromises and the ambassador who wept in private because she knew the terms were insufficient.\n\nWeeks became months. Months became years. The Treaty of Shallow Waters led to the Canal Disputes of 260, which led to the Sect Reformation of 290, which led to the Isolation Doctrine of 310, each event connected to the last by threads that only someone who had witnessed them could identify.\n\nTalindra listened. She took notes that filled volumes. She asked questions that forced Vasherak to examine memories he had not revisited in centuries, and in examining them he found details he had forgotten, nuances he had overlooked, connections he had missed when he was living through the events rather than remembering them.\n\n\'You help me remember,\' he told her one afternoon, surprised by the realization. \'I thought I was teaching you. But you are teaching me to see my own memories clearly.\'\n\n\'Perhaps that is what teaching is,\' she said. \'Two people looking at the same thing from different distances.\'\n\nHe was silent for a while. Then he said: \'You are wise for ninety.\'\n\n\'You are kind for six hundred.\'\n\nSomething shifted between them. Not suddenly. Slowly, the way rivers shift their courses -- imperceptibly in any given year, profoundly over decades. The weekly visits became daily. The historical discussions became personal. He told her about the centuries of solitude that longevity imposed -- watching friends age and die, watching lovers age and die, watching the world change while you persisted, unchanged, a stone in a river that flowed around you.\n\n\'It is not immortality,\' he said. \'Immortality would be bearable. This is duration. Duration is watching everything you love become a memory, and then watching the memory fade, and then finding that you are the only one who remembers it existed at all.\'\n\n\'I am here now,\' she said. \'I will remember with you.\'\n\n\'You are ninety. I am six hundred. The mathematics are not in our favor.\'\n\n\'The mathematics are never in anyone\'s favor. That has not stopped anyone yet.\'\n\nHe reached for her hand. She took it. His scales were cool with age. Hers were warm with youth. The thermal difference between them was measurable, precise, a data point that any Lizard Folk scientist could quantify.\n\nBut data points do not tell the whole story. They never do.\n\n\'Four hundred years,\' he said. \'I have four hundred years of teaching left in me. Perhaps more.\'\n\n\'Then teach me,\' she said. \'All of it. Every year. Every memory. Every mistake. I will carry them when you cannot.\'\n\n\'And what will you teach me?\'\n\nShe smiled. \'That six hundred years of wisdom is not worth as much as one moment of being understood.\'\n\nHe held her hand tighter. The chamber was quiet. Six centuries of collected objects surrounded them, each one a fragment of a life too long for any single person to hold alone.\n\nHe was no longer alone.\n\nThat was enough. That was everything.'

    content: 'SHIFT PARTNERS\nGuild Record -- Miners\' Guild, Personal Addendum to Rotation Log\n\nThree centuries later, they had never requested reassignment. It was not the work.\n\nThe rotation system was simple. Every dwarf served where the hold needed them. Assignments lasted one cycle -- roughly one surface year. At the end of each cycle, the guild council reviewed the roster and reassigned personnel based on current needs. No dwarf held a position permanently. No dwarf was promised continuity.\n\nExcept Borga and Kettil.\n\nThey had been assigned as shift partners in Gallery 22 of the Second Depth three hundred and seven cycles ago. A routine assignment. Two miners, one gallery, standard rotation. The guild expected them to serve one cycle, perhaps two if the vein held, and then move to wherever the stone needed them next.\n\nThree hundred and seven cycles later, they were still in Gallery 22.\n\nNot because the vein still held -- it had played out eighty cycles ago. The gallery had been repurposed as a maintenance corridor, then a storage space, then a secondary ventilation monitoring station. The work changed. The assignment changed. Borga and Kettil remained.\n\nThe guild council noticed, of course. They noticed everything. Every thirty cycles or so, a council member would review the rotation logs and flag the anomaly: two dwarves, same assignment, three centuries running, no reassignment request filed, no reassignment recommended by any supervisor.\n\nThe council would investigate. They would interview the supervisor, who would say: \'Their work is exemplary. No reason to reassign.\' They would review the productivity data, which was consistently above average. They would note the anomaly, file a comment, and move on to more pressing matters.\n\nNobody asked Borga and Kettil why they stayed. Dwarves did not ask such questions. Work was work. If the work was done well, the reasons were irrelevant.\n\nBut the reasons were not irrelevant to Borga and Kettil.\n\nThey had arrived in Gallery 22 as strangers. Borga from the western hold, transferred after a restructuring. Kettil from the deep survey teams, reassigned when a tunnel collapse eliminated his previous posting. Two dwarves with nothing in common except a shared workspace and the expectation that they would occupy it briefly.\n\nOn the first day, they divided the gallery in silence. Left side, right side. Tools organized independently. Lunch breaks staggered so they would not have to make conversation.\n\nOn the eighth day, Kettil noticed that Borga\'s pickwork followed the grain of the stone in a way that reduced fracturing by approximately fifteen percent. He had never seen anyone read stone that precisely.\n\n\'You follow the grain,\' he said. First words beyond operational necessities.\n\n\'The stone tells you where to cut,\' Borga replied. \'You just have to listen.\'\n\n\'I never learned to listen that well.\'\n\n\'I can teach you.\'\n\nShe taught him. He learned. And in learning, he showed her something she had not known -- that the deep survey techniques he had developed could identify stress fractures before they became collapses, a skill that had saved his life twice and might someday save hers.\n\nHe taught her. She learned. And the teaching became conversation, and the conversation became companionship, and the companionship became something that neither of them named because dwarves did not name things until they were finished, and this was not finished. This was ongoing. This was a vein that did not play out.\n\nFifty cycles in, Borga filed her rotation paperwork with a single note: \'Request continuation. Current assignment satisfactory.\' Kettil filed the same.\n\nA hundred cycles in, they had developed a working rhythm so precise that they could excavate a chamber twice as fast as any other pair in the hold. Their movements were complementary -- where one struck, the other braced; where one cleared, the other advanced. They did not speak while working. They did not need to.\n\nTwo hundred cycles in, the supervisor stopped filing productivity reports because the numbers had not varied in a century. \'They are Gallery 22,\' the supervisor wrote. \'Gallery 22 is them. The distinction has become academic.\'\n\nThree hundred cycles in, on a rest day, sitting in the gallery with their backs against the stone they had spent three centuries working, Borga said: \'I could have requested reassignment at any time.\'\n\n\'So could I.\'\n\n\'I did not.\'\n\n\'Neither did I.\'\n\n\'It was not the work.\'\n\n\'No. It was not the work.\'\n\nThey sat in silence. The stone was warm against their backs. Three centuries of shared labor, shared meals, shared silence, shared air. Somewhere in those centuries, the partnership had become something else, something that the rotation system did not account for and the guild council did not have a form to describe.\n\n\'I would like to continue,\' Borga said.\n\n\'The assignment?\'\n\n\'Everything.\'\n\nKettil nodded. He placed his hand over hers on the stone floor. It was the first time they had touched in three centuries of working within arm\'s reach.\n\n\'Continuation approved,\' he said.\n\nThe guild record does not note this. Guild records note assignments and productivity and operational matters. What happens between the lines of a rotation log is not the guild\'s concern.\n\nGallery 22 remains staffed. The work continues. The partners remain.'

    content: 'THE STONE DOES NOT JUDGE\nGuild Record -- Personal Account, Filed Voluntarily\n\nHe carved. She mined. They met in the deep tunnels where no schedule mattered.\n\nGrundar was a stone carver assigned to the Artisan Guild\'s decorative division. His work was considered non-essential by the rotation council -- the hold needed structural engineers and ventilation specialists and miners, not dwarves who spent their cycles turning stone into things that served no function except beauty. He was tolerated because the Guild Compact guaranteed every dwarf the right to practice their skill, but toleration is not respect, and Grundar knew the difference.\n\nDalla was a deep miner. Fifth Depth. The deepest active gallery in the hold. Her work was considered essential by everyone, because Fifth Depth mining was dangerous and difficult and only the strongest and most skilled dwarves could do it. She was respected because respect is what the hold gives to those who do work that others cannot.\n\nIn the hold\'s social architecture, they existed on opposite ends of the spectrum. She was necessary. He was decorative. She dug the stone. He prettied it up. The hold did not assign value to individuals -- this was foundational to the Compact -- but the hold was full of individuals, and individuals assigned value whether the Compact permitted it or not.\n\nGrundar spent his cycles carving. He carved the walls of communal halls with reliefs depicting the hold\'s history. He carved memorial tablets for dwarves who had died in service. He carved small figurines that he left in the corridors for anyone to take -- animals, mostly, rendered in such detail that you could count the feathers on a bird carved from granite.\n\nNobody took the figurines. They were beautiful. But beauty was not function, and function was what the hold valued.\n\nDalla found one in a corridor near the Fifth Depth access shaft. A bird. Wings spread. Every feather distinct. She picked it up and turned it in her lamp light, and something in her chest responded to it the way her hands responded to good stone -- with recognition, with the instinctive understanding that this was craft of the highest order.\n\nShe kept it. She carried it in her tool belt for six months. She did not know who had carved it.\n\nShe found out by accident. A ventilation maintenance cycle brought her through the artisan quarter, where she saw Grundar working on a wall relief. She watched his hands -- the way he held the chisel, the way he read the stone before cutting, the same listening technique that every good miner used but applied to creation rather than extraction.\n\nShe pulled the bird from her belt. \'Did you make this?\'\n\nHe looked at it. \'Yes. Corridor 14, about six months ago. Nobody took it.\'\n\n\'I took it.\'\n\nHe stared at her. Fifth Depth gear. Mineral dust in her beard. Hands that could crack stone with a pick or cradle a granite bird without scratching it.\n\n\'You are a miner,\' he said.\n\n\'You are a carver,\' she said.\n\n\'I am told the distinction matters.\'\n\n\'I am told the same. I am also told many things that I have learned to question.\'\n\nShe came back. Not to the artisan quarter -- that would have been noticed, and notice meant questions, and questions meant opinions she was not interested in hearing. She came to the deep tunnels below the Fifth Depth, where the stone was unworked and the schedules did not reach and the only light was what you brought with you.\n\nShe told Grundar about the deep tunnels. He came. He brought his chisels.\n\nIn the deep tunnels, he carved while she watched. Not walls or reliefs or functional things. He carved the stone itself -- the raw, unworked faces of chambers that no one had ever entered. He carved animals and trees and the surface sky that neither of them had seen in decades, and Dalla watched with the focused attention of a miner studying a vein, and she understood what beauty was for.\n\nIt was for this. For the moment when someone\'s hands turned dead stone into something that made your heart move.\n\n\'The hold says your work is not essential,\' she said one evening, watching him carve a running horse into the chamber wall.\n\n\'The hold is wrong.\'\n\n\'I know. I have known since I picked up that bird. Essential is not the same as necessary. The ventilation shafts are necessary. The food supply is necessary. But without this --\' she gestured at the carved horse, caught mid-stride, alive in the lamplight -- \'without this, what are we maintaining the ventilation shafts FOR?\'\n\nHe set down his chisel. He looked at her. In the deep tunnels, by lamplight, with stone dust in the air and the weight of the mountain above them, she was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen, and he had spent his life studying beauty.\n\n\'The stone does not judge,\' he said. \'Down here, there are no divisions. No essential and non-essential. No miner and carver. Just stone and the two of us.\'\n\n\'Just us,\' she agreed.\n\nShe took his hand. Hers was rough from decades of pick work. His was rough from decades of chisel work. Different calluses. Same stone.\n\nThey met in the deep tunnels for years. The hold above them rotated and assigned and maintained its careful equilibrium of function and necessity, and beneath it all, in the unscheduled dark, a miner and a carver sat together in chambers decorated with horses and birds and a sky neither of them needed to see, because they had found something better to look at.\n\nThe stone does not judge. The stone does not care who is essential. The stone simply holds whatever you carve into it, and keeps it, and does not let go.'

In that time he had watched the forest change its shape three times, had catalogued the rise and fall of two human dynasties, and had read every volume in the Archive\'s western wing. He had never been in love. He had assumed he was not built for it -- some elves were not, the way some trees did not flower. A quirk of nature. Nothing to mourn.\n\nThen Maren walked into the border trading post where he served as the Archive\'s trade liaison, and she asked for a map of the forest paths, and when he told her the forest did not permit maps she laughed -- a short, startled sound, honest and unguarded in a way that four centuries of elven composure had not prepared him for.\n\n\'Everything permits maps,\' she said. \'You just have to ask the right questions.\'\n\nShe was a cartographer. Imperial-trained, which meant she was methodical and precise and had been taught that the world was knowable if you measured it correctly. She was perhaps thirty. She carried her instruments in a leather case that she held the way a mother holds a child -- close, carefully, with the understanding that what she carried was more valuable than herself.\n\nHe should not have spoken to her beyond the transaction. Elves did not socialize with humans. The lifespan difference alone made it impractical -- why invest in a relationship that would end in a few decades? The Archive discouraged it. The Council forbade it. Common sense demanded it.\n\nHe spoke to her. He could not help it. She asked questions about the forest that no human had ever asked -- not about resources or military routes or territorial boundaries, but about the trees themselves. How old they were. How they communicated through root systems. Why certain species grew in spirals while others grew straight.\n\n\'You are not a typical cartographer,\' he said.\n\n\'Typical cartographers draw lines. I draw the world. The lines are just how I hold it on paper.\'\n\nShe came back. Once a month, with new questions and new maps. Her maps were extraordinary -- not just accurate but alive, filled with annotations about soil composition and bird migration patterns and the way the light fell through the canopy at different hours. She mapped the forest the way elves experienced it: as a living system, not a static landscape.\n\nHe showed her things. Groves that humans had never seen. Streams that changed course with the seasons. The hollow oak where the first elven archive had been founded, now empty, its walls still bearing the marks of shelves that had held the earliest records.\n\n\'This is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen,\' she said, standing inside the hollow oak, running her fingers over the shelf marks.\n\n\'You are the most beautiful thing I have ever seen,\' he said, and the words escaped before his four centuries of composure could stop them.\n\nShe looked at him. She did not laugh this time. She did not smile. She looked at him with the clear, measuring gaze of a cartographer assessing terrain, and then she said: \'I am going to die long before you. You know that.\'\n\n\'I know.\'\n\n\'And it does not stop you.\'\n\n\'Should it?\'\n\n\'Everyone else seems to think so. Your people. My people. The mathematics of it.\'\n\n\'The mathematics are real,\' he said. \'But the mathematics do not account for the fact that I have lived four hundred years and never felt this, and I may live four hundred more and never feel it again. The duration of a thing is not its value.\'\n\nShe stepped closer. She took his hand -- his long, cool, elven fingers wrapped in her short, warm, human ones.\n\n\'I will have you for seventy winters,\' she said. \'Maybe fewer. Maybe more. That is what I can offer.\'\n\n\'And after?\'\n\n\'After, you will have me for eternity in memory. And I know that elven memory does not fade. So in a way, I will live as long as you do. Just... differently.\'\n\nHe held her hand tighter. The hollow oak stood around them, ancient and empty and full of the marks of things that had been held and were held no longer.\n\n\'Seventy winters,\' he said.\n\n\'Is it enough?\'\n\n\'No. But it is what we have. And I would rather have seventy winters with you than four hundred years without.\'\n\nThey had sixty-three. She mapped every one of them -- seasons and storms and the slow changes in the forest that only someone paying attention could notice. Her maps filled a room. When she died, quietly, in the spring of their sixty-third year, he archived them in the western wing alongside the oldest records the elves possessed.\n\nThe Archive did not approve. The Council did not approve. He did not care.\n\nHer maps are still there. And he visits them. And the memory does not fade.'

    content: 'THE TRADER\'S DAUGHTER\nAnonymous -- Human and Cat Folk\n\n\'Your people call us rootless.\' \'My roots are wherever you are.\'\n\nSera grew up in her father\'s shop in the border town of Ashenmere, where the imperial trade roads met the desert paths that the Cat Folk caravans followed. She grew up watching caravans pass -- bright wagons and road-worn travelers and the sound of bells and barter that meant the Cat Folk had come to trade.\n\nHer father sold provisions. Flour, salt, dried meat, lamp oil. The staples that every caravan needed and every border town provided. He was a practical man who judged people by their coin, not their species, which made him unusual in the Holy Dominion but excellent at business.\n\n\'Coin has no race,\' he told Sera. \'Remember that and you will never go hungry.\'\n\nJorik arrived with the Amber Trail caravan on a hot afternoon in Sera\'s nineteenth year. He was young -- perhaps twenty -- with tawny fur and quick eyes and the kind of restless energy that Cat Folk carried like a second skin. He came into the shop to buy salt and ended up staying for an hour because Sera asked him about the road.\n\nNobody asked Cat Folk about the road. Humans asked about prices. About goods. About delivery schedules. Nobody asked what the road was like, as though the journey itself might be interesting.\n\n\'The road is everything,\' he told her, leaning on the counter with the easy posture of someone who had never stood still long enough to learn formality. \'The road is the stars at night and the dust at noon and the sound of the wagon wheels and the way the desert smells after rain. You cannot describe it. You have to walk it.\'\n\n\'I have never walked it,\' she said.\n\n\'That is a tragedy.\'\n\n\'That is an imperial education. We are taught that staying in one place is virtue and wandering is vagrancy.\'\n\n\'Your people call us rootless,\' he said, and there was no bitterness in it, just the patient observation of someone who had heard the word often enough to have made peace with it.\n\n\'My roots are here,\' she said, gesturing at the shop, the town, the walls that defined her world. \'But roots can be transplanted.\'\n\nHe looked at her. She looked at him. The salt sat forgotten on the counter.\n\nThe caravan stayed three days. He came to the shop every day. They talked about the road and the town and the difference between a life that moved and a life that stayed. He told her about desert sunrises. She told him about autumn in Ashenmere, when the trees turned gold and the air smelled like woodsmoke and the world felt smaller and safer than it probably was.\n\nOn the third day, he bought salt. He also bought flour, dried meat, and lamp oil -- far more than one person needed.\n\n\'That is a lot of provisions,\' she said.\n\n\'Enough for two,\' he said. \'If someone wanted to see what the road looked like.\'\n\nShe did not go. Not that time. The caravan left and she watched it from the shop window and the tightness in her chest was so acute that she mistook it for illness and spent two days in bed before admitting that she was not sick. She was grieving something she had never had.\n\nThe caravan returned four months later. Jorik walked into the shop and placed a single desert stone on the counter -- blue-green, polished by the sand, the color of deep water in a waterless land.\n\n\'I carried this for four months,\' he said. \'It reminded me of your eyes.\'\n\nShe picked up the stone. She held it to the light. Then she looked at him and said: \'How long does the caravan stay?\'\n\n\'Three days.\'\n\n\'I need four. One to pack. Three to learn the road.\'\n\nShe told her father. He did not argue. He had watched her watch the caravans for nineteen years, and he had seen what happened when she talked to the young Cat Folk trader, and coin had no race and neither did the look in his daughter\'s eyes.\n\n\'Take the good salt,\' he said. \'And come back when you want to. The shop will be here.\'\n\nShe packed. She took the good salt. She walked out of Ashenmere beside a Cat Folk caravan and the road opened before her like a book she had waited her whole life to read.\n\nJorik walked beside her. She walked beside him. And when she asked where they were going, he said everywhere, and she said good, and the desert stretched out before them, rootless and free and exactly where they both belonged.'

    content: 'AGAINST THE STEPPES\nAnonymous -- Human and Orc\n\nHe was a hostage. She was his keeper. \'I was not told what to feel.\'\n\nThe border treaties between the Holy Dominion and the orcish clans included a provision that both sides found distasteful but necessary: hostage exchanges. Each side held a citizen of the other as guarantee of good faith. If the treaty was broken, the hostage was forfeit.\n\nLieutenant Edric Voss was not a volunteer. He was selected because he was junior enough to be expendable and senior enough to represent the empire with dignity. He was told to maintain imperial bearing at all times, to observe and report on orcish military capabilities, and to survive.\n\nHe was not told what to do about Rashana.\n\nShe was assigned as his keeper -- the orc responsible for ensuring the hostage remained healthy, secure, and alive. She was from the Storm-Keeper clan, a rider with a scar across her left cheek and the direct manner that all orcs possessed and that all imperial officers found unnerving.\n\n\'You are my responsibility,\' she told him on the first day. \'If you try to escape, I will stop you. If you are injured, I will treat you. If you are hungry, I will feed you. You are not a prisoner. You are a guest whose departure would be inconvenient.\'\n\n\'That is the most diplomatically honest thing anyone has ever said to me,\' he replied.\n\n\'Orcs do not do diplomacy. We do honesty. Diplomacy is what happens when honesty is too expensive.\'\n\nThe clan moved with the seasons. Edric moved with them. He rode -- badly at first, then less badly, then competently, because Rashana taught him with the blunt patience of a woman who trained horses and considered humans only slightly more complicated.\n\n\'Your balance is wrong,\' she said, for the fortieth time. \'You sit on the horse. You should sit IN the horse. Part of it. Not on top of it.\'\n\n\'I am a foot soldier. We do not ride.\'\n\n\'You ride now. Learn.\'\n\nHe learned. He learned riding and he learned the orcish language and he learned to sleep on the ground and eat food cooked over dung fires and read the weather by the behavior of the herd animals. He learned that the clans were not the savage war bands that the empire described in its briefings but complex societies with legal codes and art and a philosophical tradition that, while different from anything he had been taught, was no less rigorous.\n\nHe learned Rashana. This was not in his orders.\n\nShe was kind in the way that strong people are kind -- without softness, without condescension, with the absolute confidence that kindness and strength were not opposites but the same thing expressed in different circumstances. She brought him extra blankets in the cold without being asked. She taught him the star patterns that the clans used for navigation. She told him stories around the fire, and when the other orcs stared at the human in their midst, she stared back until they looked away.\n\n\'You defend me,\' he said one evening, after she had silenced a young warrior who had called him an imperial dog.\n\n\'You are my responsibility.\'\n\n\'It feels like more than responsibility.\'\n\nShe was quiet for a long time. The fire crackled. The steppe wind moved the grass in waves that looked like a dark ocean.\n\n\'I was assigned to keep you alive,\' she said. \'I was not told what to feel while doing it.\'\n\n\'And what do you feel?\'\n\n\'Something that the clan code does not address and the treaty does not permit. Something that is going to be a problem when the treaty ends and you go home.\'\n\n\'What if I do not go home?\'\n\nShe looked at him. In the firelight, with the steppe behind her and the stars above and the sound of horses in the darkness, she looked at him the way she looked at the horizon -- as though he were something vast and unknowable and worth riding toward.\n\n\'The empire would consider you a deserter,\' she said.\n\n\'The empire considers many things. I have learned that the empire is wrong about most of them.\'\n\n\'My clan would have to accept you. An outsider. A human.\'\n\n\'Would they?\'\n\n\'If I asked them. If I told them that you ride well enough and work hard enough and that your presence strengthens the clan rather than weakening it.\'\n\n\'Does it?\'\n\n\'It strengthens me. That strengthens the clan. The logic is sound.\'\n\nThe treaty ended after two years. The empire sent a courier for Edric. He was standing beside Rashana when the courier arrived. His imperial uniform had been replaced by riding leathers. His posture had changed -- looser, more balanced, the posture of a man who sat in his horse rather than on it.\n\n\'Lieutenant Voss,\' the courier said. \'You are recalled to the capital.\'\n\n\'My name is Edric,\' he said. \'Tell the capital I am not coming.\'\n\nThe courier left. Edric stayed. The clan accepted him, not because they loved him but because Rashana asked, and Rashana had earned the right to ask.\n\nHe rode the steppe for thirty-eight more years. He never returned to the empire. He never regretted it.\n\nThe orders said survive. They did not say where.'

    content: 'THE STONE AND THE SKY\nAnonymous -- Dwarf and Orc\n\n\'How do you live beneath the earth?\' \'How do you live beneath nothing?\'\n\nThe trade delegation was an experiment. The orcish Windrunner clan needed refined metals. The dwarven hold of Ironhearth needed hides and horn. A trade route through the border passes made logical sense to both sides and emotional sense to neither, because dwarves and orcs had spent centuries regarding each other with mutual incomprehension.\n\nHeldra was the dwarven trade representative. Selected for her patience, which was exceptional even by dwarven standards, and her ability to remain calm in situations that would cause other dwarves to retreat to the comforting certainty of stone walls.\n\nGarak was the orcish trade liaison. Selected for his curiosity, which was unusual among the steppe clans, and his ability to sit still for more than ten minutes, which was rarer.\n\nThey met at the border pass. A stone table set between the mountain and the grassland. She arrived from below. He arrived from above. They looked at each other across the table -- she short, solid, gray-eyed, with the permanent stone dust in her beard that marked a working dwarf; he tall, broad, wind-burned, with the distant stare of someone accustomed to horizons.\n\n\'How do you live beneath the earth?\' he asked. First words. No greeting. Orcs did not waste time on preamble.\n\n\'How do you live beneath nothing?\' she replied. No greeting either. Dwarves appreciated directness.\n\nHe blinked. \'Nothing?\'\n\n\'Your sky. It is nothing. Empty space above your head. How do you sleep without stone overhead? How do you think without walls?\'\n\n\'How do you breathe without wind?\'\n\n\'We have ventilation shafts.\'\n\n\'That is not wind. That is... controlled air. Tame air. Wind is alive. Wind pushes you and tests you and tells you where the storm is. Your shafts tell you nothing.\'\n\n\'Our shafts tell us everything we need to know. Air quality. Temperature. Pressure. Wind tells you nothing except that the sky is moving, which it always is, and that information is useless.\'\n\nThey argued for three hours. The trade negotiation was supposed to last one hour. Neither noticed. The other delegates waited, then ate lunch, then napped, then gave up and went home, leaving Heldra and Garak still arguing about the comparative merits of stone versus sky.\n\nThe trade route was established despite the delegates, not because of them. Heldra and Garak continued to argue at every meeting, which occurred monthly, which was far more frequently than a simple metals-for-hides exchange required. Neither acknowledged this.\n\nIn the fourth month, the argument shifted. He told her about the steppe at dawn -- the way the light came up over the grass like molten copper and the world was so wide that you could see the curve of the earth. She told him about the deep caverns -- the way the crystal veins caught lamplight and scattered it into colors that had no names and the silence was so complete that you could hear your own heart.\n\nThey were not arguing anymore. They were sharing. The distinction was important.\n\nIn the eighth month, she said: \'I would like to see your steppe.\'\n\n\'You would hate it. No ceiling. No walls. Nothing between you and the sky.\'\n\n\'I know. I would like to see it anyway.\'\n\nHe took her to the steppe. She stood in the open grass, under the naked sky, and she looked up and saw nothing -- no stone, no ceiling, no structure between herself and the infinite emptiness of the atmosphere -- and her heart pounded and her hands clenched and she understood, viscerally, why dwarves built holds.\n\n\'It is terrifying,\' she whispered.\n\n\'Yes,\' he said. \'And beautiful.\'\n\nShe looked again. Past the fear. The sky was pink at the edges and blue in the center and there were clouds that moved like living things and the wind -- the real wind, not the controlled air of ventilation shafts -- pressed against her face and smelled like grass and distance.\n\n\'Yes,\' she admitted. \'Beautiful.\'\n\nShe took him to the hold. He descended through the access shafts, past the first depth, past the second, into the deep halls where the crystal veins glowed in the lamplight. He stood in the silence and felt the weight of the mountain above him and his breath came short and his eyes widened and he understood, viscerally, why orcs rode the steppe.\n\n\'It is terrifying,\' he whispered.\n\n\'Yes,\' she said. \'And beautiful.\'\n\nHe looked again. Past the fear. The stone was warm and the crystals scattered light into colors that the sky had never held and the silence was not empty but full -- full of the deep pulse of the earth, the heartbeat of a living mountain.\n\n\'Yes,\' he admitted. \'Beautiful.\'\n\nThey stood in the crystal hall -- a dwarf and an orc, stone and sky, each afraid and each awed and each holding the other\'s hand because some things are too large to face alone.\n\n\'We are very different,\' she said.\n\n\'We are very different,\' he agreed.\n\n\'This will be difficult.\'\n\n\'Most things worth doing are.\'\n\nThey met at the border pass. Monthly. Then weekly. Then as often as the distances allowed. She never loved the sky. He never loved the stone. But they loved each other, and that was a bridge between the two worlds that neither architecture nor open air could provide.'

    content: 'DIFFERENT SANDS\nAnonymous -- Lizard Folk and Cat Folk\n\nShe hid in secrecy. He wandered in openness. Neither learned. Both stayed.\n\nThe desert does not belong to anyone. This is what both peoples understand, though they understand it differently. The Lizard Folk hide beneath the dunes, in underground cisterns and sect compounds, invisible to the surface world. The Cat Folk travel across the dunes, in caravans that follow routes older than memory, visible to everyone and beholden to none.\n\nOne hides. The other wanders. The desert holds them both.\n\nTessith was a Lizard Folk water scout -- one of the rare sect members authorized to operate on the surface, mapping wells and seasonal springs for the underground communities. She moved at night, used thermal camouflage, and left no tracks. The desert was a workplace, not a home. She did her job and returned below.\n\nRavel was a Cat Folk pathfinder -- a caravan scout who rode ahead of the wagons to identify water sources, safe campsites, and hazards. He moved by day, read the sand the way other people read books, and knew every dune by the shape of its shadow.\n\nThey found the same spring on the same night.\n\nIt was a seasonal spring -- a crack in the bedrock where underground water seeped to the surface during the cooler months. Tessith was mapping it for the Water Engineers. Ravel was marking it for the caravan. They arrived within minutes of each other, from opposite directions, and met at the water\'s edge in the moonlight.\n\nTessith froze. Lizard Folk training was clear: surface contact was forbidden. Abort. Retreat. Report.\n\nRavel tilted his head. Cat Folk curiosity was stronger than caution, always had been, probably always would be.\n\n\'I thought we were the only ones who knew about this spring,\' he said.\n\nShe should have run. She stayed.\n\n\'You are not,\' she said.\n\n\'Lizard Folk? I have never spoken to a Lizard Folk. I was not sure you existed. The caravans tell stories but stories are unreliable.\'\n\n\'We prefer it that way.\'\n\n\'Prefer what? Being stories?\'\n\n\'Being unreliable. If people are not sure we exist, they do not look for us.\'\n\nHe sat down beside the spring. After a moment, she sat too. The desert was quiet. The water murmured.\n\n\'Your people hide,\' he said. \'Mine wander. We are both impossible to find, just for different reasons.\'\n\n\'Your people are not impossible to find. Your caravans leave tracks across half the desert.\'\n\n\'Tracks are not the same as location. By the time anyone follows our tracks, we have moved. The tracks show where we WERE. Nobody knows where we ARE.\'\n\nShe considered this. It was, she admitted, a valid form of concealment. Different from her people\'s approach but functionally similar.\n\n\'We are more alike than I expected,\' she said.\n\n\'We are both people of the sand. The sand connects us even when our methods differ.\'\n\nThey met at the spring again. Not by arrangement -- arrangement would have required trust, and trust required time. But both needed to map the spring\'s output over the season, and both returned on predictable schedules, and after the third coincidental meeting they stopped pretending it was coincidental.\n\nHe told her about the road. The way the desert changed color at different hours. The sound the dunes made when the wind shifted. The stories the caravans carried like cargo, traded at every stop, accumulating details with each retelling until the truth was buried so deep in embellishment that only a Cat Folk could dig it out.\n\nShe told him about the underground. The cool silence of the cisterns. The way the Lizard Folk read the earth through vibrations, feeling the desert\'s pulse the way a physician feels a heartbeat. The sect rivalries that outsiders never saw, the politics of knowledge in a society where knowledge was the only currency.\n\nHe was open where she was closed. She was still where he was restless. He lived in daylight. She lived in darkness. They should have had nothing in common except the spring.\n\nThey had everything in common. They were both travelers in a landscape that did not care about them. They were both skilled at surviving in conditions that killed the unprepared. They both understood loneliness -- his the loneliness of the pathfinder who rode ahead of the caravan, hers the loneliness of the scout who worked alone on the surface.\n\n\'Come below,\' she said one night. \'I will show you the cisterns.\'\n\n\'Come above,\' he said. \'I will show you the sunrise.\'\n\nNeither went. The invitation hung between them, acknowledged and deferred, because both understood that crossing into each other\'s world would change something that could not be unchanged.\n\nThey met at the spring for three years. Every meeting was a risk -- for her, the risk of discovery and sect censure; for him, the risk of falling behind the caravan and being left in the desert. They took the risk anyway, because the spring was where their worlds overlapped, and in that overlap they had built something that neither secrecy nor wandering could contain.\n\nNeither learned the other\'s way. She did not become open. He did not become hidden. But they stayed. At the spring, in the moonlight, in the small shared space where different sands met and the desert held them both.'

    content: 'THE SPY AND THE SCHOLAR\nAnonymous -- Elf and Lizard Folk\n\nThey spent a decade pretending not to know each other\'s purpose.\n\nThe elven Archive sent observers to every civilization. This was not secret -- it was policy. The Archive existed to record. Recording required observation. Observation required presence. And so, in every major city and settlement across the known world, there was an elf. Watching. Writing. Cataloguing the slow unfolding of history in real time.\n\nIlyndra was the observer assigned to the Lizard Folk territories. Her cover was simple: a traveling scholar interested in desert ecology. It was not entirely false. She was interested in desert ecology. She was also interested in sect power structures, water control infrastructure, military capabilities, and the intricate web of alliances and rivalries that held the Lizard Folk civilization together.\n\nShe was, in every way that mattered, a spy.\n\nSethek was a Lizard Folk information officer assigned to monitor foreign agents in sect territory. His people knew the elves sent observers. They tolerated it because the elves shared their findings -- selectively, carefully, but shared nonetheless -- and because the alternative was expelling the observers and losing access to the most comprehensive information network on the continent.\n\nSethek was assigned to observe the observer. He was, in every way that mattered, her counterpart.\n\nHe introduced himself as a guide. She accepted him as a guide. Both knew exactly what the other was. Neither said so.\n\n\'The eastern cisterns are fascinating,\' Ilyndra said on their first expedition together. \'The engineering is remarkable.\'\n\n\'I would be happy to show you the non-classified sections,\' Sethek replied.\n\n\'I am interested in all sections.\'\n\n\'I am aware.\'\n\nThey smiled at each other. The kind of smile that two professionals exchange when they recognize their own craft in someone else -- the smile of mutual respect wearing the mask of polite fiction.\n\nHe showed her what the sects permitted. She recorded it with the meticulous precision of an archivist who understood that what was shown was less important than what was hidden, and that the shape of the hidden could be deduced from the shape of the shown.\n\nHe watched her deduce. She was good. Every question she asked was designed to triangulate the answer to a question she had not asked. Every observation she recorded contained an inference about something she had not been shown. He found this impressive. He also found it dangerous, which in his line of work was often the same thing.\n\nShe watched him watch her. He was good. Every answer he gave was precisely calibrated to reveal exactly enough to seem transparent while concealing everything that mattered. Every location he chose for their expeditions was selected to control her exposure to sensitive information. He was, she realized, the most elegant counterintelligence operative she had encountered in three centuries of observation work.\n\nShe found this impressive. She also found it attractive, which in her line of work was always dangerous.\n\nThe years passed. They maintained the fiction. She was a scholar. He was a guide. She asked questions. He deflected them. She deduced. He observed. The dance was intricate, professional, and performed with such grace that an outsider would have seen nothing except a researcher and her local contact.\n\nBut in the spaces between the dance steps -- in the evenings by the campfire, in the long walks between sites, in the silences that accumulated like sand -- something else grew. Something that neither of them had planned for and neither could report to their superiors without compromising their mission.\n\nIn the fifth year, she told him about the Archive. Not classified information -- the philosophy. Why the elves recorded. What they hoped to preserve. The belief that memory was the only immortality that mattered, and that the Archive was not a building but a promise to the future that the past would not be forgotten.\n\nShe told him this in the desert, at night, under stars that both their peoples navigated by, and she told him because she wanted him to understand her, and understanding was more dangerous than any classified document.\n\nIn the sixth year, he told her about the sects. Not classified information -- the fear. Why the Lizard Folk hid. What they had lost when the surface world had turned hostile. The understanding that knowledge was the only weapon that could not be taken by force, and that secrecy was not paranoia but survival.\n\nHe told her this in the same desert, under the same stars, and he told her because she had offered understanding and he could not refuse it without refusing himself.\n\nIn the ninth year, sitting by a fire in the deep desert, she said: \'We have been pretending for nine years.\'\n\n\'We have been professional for nine years. Pretending and professionalism overlap significantly.\'\n\n\'They do. But there is a remainder. The part that is not professional. The part that stays after the reports are filed and the intelligence is catalogued. What do we do with that remainder?\'\n\n\'I have been asking myself that question for approximately six years,\' he said.\n\n\'And?\'\n\n\'I have no answer that my superiors would accept.\'\n\n\'Neither do mine.\'\n\nThe fire crackled. The stars turned slowly overhead. Two intelligence operatives from two secretive civilizations sat in the desert and looked at each other without masks for the first time in a decade.\n\n\'I know you are a spy,\' he said.\n\n\'I know you are my handler,\' she said.\n\n\'We have wasted ten years pretending otherwise.\'\n\n\'Not wasted. Spent. The pretending gave us time. And in that time I have come to know you better than anyone I have met in four centuries of observation. The pretending was not the waste. Continuing to pretend would be.\'\n\nHe reached across the space between them. She took his hand. His scales were cool against her skin. Her skin was warm against his scales. The temperature difference was measurable. What it meant was not.\n\nThey continued their work. She observed. He managed her observation. Their reports remained professional, accurate, and carefully incomplete. The things that mattered most -- the conversations by the fire, the silences in the desert, the slow accumulation of trust between two people whose professions were built on distrust -- never appeared in any archive or any sect record.\n\nSome intelligence is too valuable to share with anyone except the person it belongs to.'

    content: 'FORTY YEARS, FOUR CENTURIES\nAnonymous -- Human and Dwarf\n\n\'It is inefficient,\' he admitted. \'Love is not a rotation schedule,\' she said.\n\nThe Merchants Guild sent Tormund to the surface trade post in the human border town of Millhaven. Standard assignment. One cycle. Sell dwarven metalwork. Buy grain and timber. Return. Do not form attachments.\n\nElise ran the granary in Millhaven. She was thirty-two, widowed young, practical in the way that women who run granaries in border towns are practical -- which is to say, entirely. She measured grain by weight and people by character and found both to be more reliable indicators than reputation.\n\nTormund arrived with a wagon of ironwork and the expectation that the transaction would take three days. He walked into the granary to negotiate the grain purchase and found a woman who haggled with the same precision that dwarves applied to metallurgy.\n\n\'Your price is fourteen percent above the regional average,\' he said.\n\n\'Your ironwork is twenty percent above the regional average,\' she replied. \'Because it is twenty percent better. My grain is fourteen percent above the regional average because it is fourteen percent drier, which means it stores longer. Quality commands a premium. I believe your people invented that principle.\'\n\nHe was so startled that he laughed. Dwarves did not laugh during trade negotiations. It was not in the manual. But she had quoted dwarven economic philosophy at a dwarf, and the audacity of it cracked something in his professional composure that he had not known could crack.\n\n\'Where did you learn dwarven pricing theory?\' he asked.\n\n\'From the last dwarven trader. And the one before that. I have been buying from your people for eleven years. I pay attention.\'\n\n\'You pay attention better than most dwarves I know.\'\n\n\'That is because most dwarves assume humans cannot learn. We can. We are just shorter-lived, so we have to learn faster.\'\n\nThe transaction took three days. He stayed for seven. There was always another detail to discuss, another term to negotiate, another reason to return to the granary where Elise weighed grain and spoke with the crisp efficiency of a guild clerk.\n\nHe returned the following cycle. And the one after that. The guild noted that Tormund\'s Millhaven assignments consistently produced above-average trade results, which was true. They did not note that the above-average results were because he spent extra time cultivating a relationship with the town\'s primary grain supplier, which was also true. They did not note why.\n\nIn the fourth cycle, sitting in the granary after hours, sharing a meal that she had cooked and he had supplied the ingredients for -- dwarven spices, unavailable in border towns, which he carried in his personal pack rather than the trade wagon -- he said: \'This is inefficient.\'\n\n\'What is?\'\n\n\'Meeting once a year. For seven days. It is not enough.\'\n\nShe set down her fork. \'It is what the guild allows.\'\n\n\'The guild allows what the guild understands. The guild does not understand this.\'\n\n\'What is \'this,\' Tormund?\'\n\nHe looked at his plate. Dwarves were not built for emotional declarations. They were built for stone and metal and the patient, methodical work of making things that lasted. But some things needed to be said even by people who were not built for saying them.\n\n\'I think about you between cycles,\' he said. \'I think about the way you measure grain. I think about the way you argue pricing. I think about the way you look when you are concentrating, which is all the time, because you are the most focused person I have ever met and I have met dwarves who carve stone for three centuries without looking up.\'\n\nShe was quiet for a moment. Then: \'How long do dwarves live?\'\n\n\'Four hundred years. Sometimes more.\'\n\n\'I have perhaps forty left. That is one-tenth of your life. Not even one-tenth. A fraction.\'\n\n\'I know the mathematics.\'\n\n\'The mathematics are not in our favor.\'\n\n\'Love is not a rotation schedule,\' he said, and the words came out with the quiet certainty of a dwarf who had measured the stone and found it sound. \'You do not allocate it based on duration. You allocate it based on value. And forty years with you would be worth more than four centuries without.\'\n\nShe reached across the table and took his hand. His was broad and calloused from metalwork. Hers was strong and calloused from granary work. Different trades. Same calluses.\n\n\'The guild will not approve,\' she said.\n\n\'The guild approves of results. I will give them results.\'\n\n\'My town will talk.\'\n\n\'Let them talk. I have four centuries of patience. I can outlast gossip.\'\n\nShe laughed. He laughed. And in the granary in Millhaven, over a meal seasoned with dwarven spices, they stopped counting the years they would not have and started counting the ones they would.\n\nHe filed for permanent surface assignment. The guild granted it after reviewing his trade results, which were, as promised, exceptional. He lived in Millhaven for thirty-seven years. He sold ironwork. She sold grain. They ate together every evening.\n\nWhen she died, he returned to the hold. He lived for three more centuries. He never requested another surface assignment.\n\nBut every cycle, on the anniversary of his first visit to the granary, he cooked a meal with the spices he had once carried in his personal pack, and he ate it alone, and the four hundred years of dwarven patience held the memory without letting it fade.'

    content: 'THE WARREN AND THE ROAD\nAnonymous -- Goblin and Cat Folk\n\nBoth outcasts. Both distrusted. They met in the spaces between.\n\nFitch had been running for two years. His warren had burned in the Eighth Clearance Campaign -- the empire\'s latest attempt to solve the goblin problem through fire and steel. He had escaped through the deep tunnels with eleven others. Over the following months, the group dwindled as they scattered to find shelter with other warrens, with sympathetic farmers, with anyone who would hide a goblin long enough for the patrols to pass.\n\nBy the time Fitch reached the desert border, he was alone. Alone was dangerous for a goblin in imperial territory. Alone meant no lookouts, no shared watches, no one to distract a patrol while you ran. Alone meant that every sound in the dark was a threat and every stranger was an enemy.\n\nYara found him in a ditch.\n\nShe was a Cat Folk pathfinder, scouting ahead of a caravan that had been denied entry to the last three towns because a local magistrate had decided that Cat Folk traders were depressing grain prices. Denied entry was polite language for threatened with violence. The caravan had rerouted through the borderlands, where there were no towns and no magistrates and also no water.\n\nFitch was in the ditch because ditches were safe. Yara was on the road because roads led somewhere. She spotted him because Cat Folk could see in the dark and goblins, despite their best efforts, were not invisible.\n\n\'If you are hiding,\' she said, looking down at him, \'you should know that your ear is visible above the edge.\'\n\nHe pressed his ear down. \'Better?\'\n\n\'Marginally.\'\n\nShe should have kept walking. Cat Folk and goblins had no alliance, no shared history, no reason to help each other. They occupied different layers of the world\'s margins -- Cat Folk distrusted for their wandering, goblins hated for their existence. Helping a goblin in imperial territory was a crime. Harboring a goblin was a worse crime. Being caught was the worst crime of all.\n\nShe climbed into the ditch.\n\n\'I have water,\' she said. \'And dried meat. When did you last eat?\'\n\n\'Two days ago. Maybe three. I lost count.\'\n\nShe gave him water. She gave him meat. She did not ask why he was in a ditch because the answer was obvious. Goblins were always in ditches. The empire made sure of it.\n\n\'Where are you going?\' she asked.\n\n\'Away from the empire.\'\n\n\'That is not a destination. That is a direction.\'\n\n\'For goblins, a direction is enough. We do not get destinations.\'\n\nShe looked at him for a long time. He was small, thin, dirty, frightened, and utterly without options. She recognized the look. She had seen it on Cat Folk faces in towns that refused them entry -- the look of someone who had been told, by the world\'s entire structure, that they did not belong.\n\n\'My caravan is two miles south,\' she said. \'We are also going away from the empire. You can come with us. We are not popular enough to worry about adding one more unpopular person.\'\n\nHe went with her. The caravan accepted him with the resigned tolerance of people who understood what it meant to be unwelcome. He was small enough to fit in a supply wagon. He was clever enough to make himself useful -- goblins learned repair work in the warrens, and his hands could fix wagon wheels and mend harnesses and patch water skins.\n\nHe made himself indispensable. It was the goblin survival strategy: be too useful to discard.\n\nYara watched him work. She watched him flinch at loud sounds. She watched him check exits in every room, every campsite, every space he entered -- the automatic vigilance of someone who had learned that safety was temporary and escape routes were essential.\n\n\'You can stop checking the exits,\' she told him, after a month on the road.\n\n\'I cannot. It is how I stay alive.\'\n\n\'It is how you stayed alive alone. You are not alone now.\'\n\nHe looked at her. The look was complicated -- gratitude and disbelief and the fragile, tentative beginning of trust, which for a goblin was the most dangerous emotion of all because trust required lowering defenses and lowered defenses got you killed.\n\n\'Why did you stop?\' he asked. \'At the ditch. You could have walked past.\'\n\n\'Because I have been walked past. And I remember how it felt.\'\n\nThe caravan traveled. Months became a year. Fitch stopped sleeping in the supply wagon and started sleeping by the fire. He stopped checking exits in camp. He did not stop checking exits in towns, because towns were different and some lessons could not be unlearned.\n\nYara walked beside him in the evenings, after her scouting was done and his repairs were finished. They talked about the road and the warren and the spaces between civilizations where people like them existed -- not citizens of any nation, not members of any society, just travelers in a world that had not made room for them.\n\n\'I have never belonged anywhere,\' he said one evening.\n\n\'Neither have I,\' she said. \'Cat Folk belong to the road. But the road does not belong to anyone. It is a borrowed home.\'\n\n\'Then we are both borrowing.\'\n\n\'Yes. But we are borrowing the same road. That counts for something.\'\n\nIt counted for everything. In the spaces between, where outcasts and wanderers met, a goblin and a Cat Folk walked the same road and found that belonging was not a place. It was a person.\n\nHe stopped checking exits when she was nearby. That was the truest thing he had ever given anyone.'

    content: 'CHILDREN OF FUNCTION\nAnonymous -- Gnome and Dwarf\n\nThey debated for fifty years before realizing they had started flirting.\n\nThe Gnomish Collective and the dwarven holds maintained a single diplomatic channel: the Technical Exchange. Twice a year, one representative from each civilization met at a neutral location to share non-classified engineering data. The meetings were dry, precise, and extraordinarily productive, because both gnomes and dwarves valued function above all else and neither wasted time on pleasantries.\n\nCitizen 6-3370 -- Pella -- represented the Collective for the geothermal division. She had been selected for her technical expertise and her ability to interact with outsiders without revealing classified information, which required a specific combination of intelligence, discipline, and the capacity to be friendly without being open.\n\nForge-Master Uldin represented the dwarven Smiths\' Guild. He had been selected for his encyclopedic knowledge of metallurgy and his reputation as the most stubborn negotiator in the hold, which the guild considered a qualification rather than a personality flaw.\n\nTheir first meeting lasted nine hours. They debated the optimal alloy composition for geothermal pipe fittings. Pella argued for a copper-tin blend with trace crystalline additives. Uldin argued for traditional dwarven deep-iron. Both presented data. Both rejected each other\'s data. Both requested a follow-up meeting to resolve the dispute.\n\nThe follow-up meeting lasted eleven hours. The dispute was not resolved. A third meeting was scheduled.\n\nThe third meeting lasted fourteen hours and ended only because both representatives needed to sleep. The dispute had expanded from pipe fittings to encompass fundamental disagreements about the nature of heat transfer in geological substrates.\n\n\'Your models assume uniform conductivity,\' Pella said, for the third time in as many hours. \'Stone is not uniform. It is heterogeneous. Your calculations work in theory and fail in practice because you do not account for the grain structure.\'\n\n\'Our calculations have built holds that have stood for four thousand years,\' Uldin replied. \'Your calculations have built... what? An island? With clockwork?\'\n\n\'An island with clockwork that generates more thermal energy per capita than any dwarven hold in recorded history.\'\n\n\'Per capita. Because you have a fraction of our population. Scale your efficiency numbers to our population and watch them collapse.\'\n\n\'They would not collapse. They would require adjustment. That is what engineering IS -- adjustment. Your people build a thing once and maintain it forever. My people build a thing, measure it, improve it, rebuild it, and repeat. Progress requires iteration.\'\n\n\'Permanence requires doing it right the first time.\'\n\nThey glared at each other across the table. Then Pella laughed. It was a small, involuntary sound -- the laugh of someone who has encountered a worthy opponent and cannot help but appreciate the craftsmanship of the opposition.\n\nUldin almost smiled. Almost. It was the dwarven equivalent of rolling on the floor.\n\nThe meetings continued. Twice a year. Nine hours, eleven hours, fourteen hours. The debates expanded to cover metallurgy, structural engineering, energy systems, ventilation design, and -- on one memorable occasion -- the philosophical question of whether a tool that lasted forever was superior to a tool that could be improved.\n\n\'A hammer that lasts a thousand years is a monument to its maker,\' Uldin said.\n\n\'A hammer that improves every decade is a monument to progress,\' Pella replied.\n\n\'Progress is change. Change is loss.\'\n\n\'Change is also gain. You only see the loss because you are a dwarf and dwarves are allergic to letting go of anything, including outdated hammer designs.\'\n\n\'Outdated? That hammer design is three thousand years old.\'\n\n\'Yes. Exactly. THREE THOUSAND YEARS old. And you are still using it. This is not tradition. This is stubbornness.\'\n\n\'Thank you. Stubbornness is a virtue.\'\n\nThirty years passed. The debates showed no sign of resolution. Both civilizations benefited enormously from the technical exchange -- problems solved, innovations shared, engineering boundaries pushed. The diplomatic channel was considered the most productive inter-civilization program in recorded history.\n\nThe diplomats credited the technical compatibility of the two civilizations. They were not wrong. But they were not entirely right, either.\n\nIn the forty-second year, after a thirteen-hour debate about crystal resonance applications in structural monitoring, Pella said: \'I look forward to these meetings more than any other event in my calendar.\'\n\n\'The technical exchange is valuable,\' Uldin agreed.\n\n\'It is not the exchange I look forward to. It is the debate. It is the way your face changes when I present data you cannot refute. It is the sound of your voice when you are absolutely certain you are right, which is always, even when you are wrong. It is... you. I look forward to you.\'\n\nUldin set down his metallurgical samples. He looked at Pella with the expression of a dwarf who has just discovered an unexpected vein of precious ore in what he thought was ordinary stone.\n\n\'We have been debating for forty-two years,\' he said slowly.\n\n\'Yes.\'\n\n\'At what point did the debating become... something else?\'\n\n\'I believe,\' Pella said, \'approximately year eight. When you called my crystalline additive theory \'inspired nonsense.\' No one had ever called my work inspired before. The nonsense part I could have done without. But the inspired part -- I went home and thought about it for three months.\'\n\n\'Year twelve for me,\' Uldin said. \'When you dismantled my deep-iron thesis in four sentences. I was furious for a week. Then I realized I was not furious. I was impressed. And then I realized that being impressed by a gnome was not something the guild had prepared me for.\'\n\nThey sat in silence. Fifty years of shared tables and shared arguments and shared dedication to the craft of building things that worked.\n\n\'This is deeply impractical,\' Pella said.\n\n\'Catastrophically impractical,\' Uldin agreed.\n\n\'Our civilizations will not approve.\'\n\n\'Our civilizations do not need to know. They need the technical exchange. What happens between the data presentations is not in the mandate.\'\n\nShe extended her hand across the table. He took it. Her fingers were small and precise. His were broad and strong. Different engineering traditions. Same calluses.\n\n\'Children of function,\' she said. \'Both of us. We build things that work. Perhaps we have built this.\'\n\n\'It works,\' he said. \'I do not understand how. But it works.\'\n\n\'Then stop trying to understand it and maintain it. That is what you are good at.\'\n\n\'And you will improve it?\'\n\n\'Every iteration.\'\n\nThe technical exchange continued. The debates continued. The diplomats continued to credit the remarkable productivity of the program to technical compatibility. And twice a year, at a neutral table between a mountain and an island, a gnome and a dwarf argued about engineering and built something that neither of their civilizations had a blueprint for.'

    content: 'THE RESISTANCE AND THE ROAD\nAnonymous -- Goblin and Human\n\n\'Your people burned my warren.\' \'My people burned my conscience.\' They found forgiveness.\n\nKira had been a soldier. Imperial infantry, Third Eastern Legion, the unit assigned to the Eighth Clearance Campaign. She had followed orders. She had entered the warrens with torch and sword. She had done what the empire asked, and the empire had called it service, and for three years afterward she had not been able to sleep without hearing the screaming.\n\nShe deserted on a Tuesday. Walked out of the barracks in the middle of the night, left her armor and her sword and her name, and walked east until the empire was behind her and the borderlands stretched ahead and she was nobody.\n\nNobody was better than what she had been.\n\nQuill had been in Thornhollow. Not the famous Thornhollow of the songs -- a different one, a smaller warren with no songs and no stories, just three hundred goblins who had lived quietly in the hills until the Third Eastern Legion arrived. He had been twelve. He remembered the fire and the screaming and his mother\'s hand pulling him through the escape tunnels. He remembered the surface, cold and bright and hostile, and the long walk to the next warren, and the next, and the next, because no warren was safe and the empire\'s torches never stopped.\n\nHe was twenty-seven when he met Kira. She was sitting in a border tavern, drinking alone, with the thousand-yard stare of a person who had seen things that alcohol could not erase. He was passing through on resistance business -- courier work, carrying messages between cells, the same dangerous, essential work that kept the resistance alive.\n\nHe did not recognize her as a soldier. She had lost the posture, the uniform, the bearing. She looked like what she was: a broken person in a border town, trying to drink herself out of a memory.\n\nHe sat at the bar because the other seats were taken. She glanced at him. He glanced at her. Two strangers in a place designed for strangers.\n\n\'You are a goblin,\' she said.\n\n\'You are observant.\'\n\n\'I used to be a soldier.\'\n\nHe went still. Every goblin in imperial territory learned to identify soldiers. It was survival. And this woman -- haggard, drunk, civilian-dressed -- had just admitted to being one of the people who burned warrens.\n\n\'I should leave,\' he said.\n\n\'Probably. But I should tell you something first, because I have not said it to anyone and I need to say it to someone and you are the someone who deserves to hear it.\'\n\nHe stayed. He did not know why. Goblin instinct said run. Something else -- curiosity, or stubbornness, or the inexplicable sense that this moment mattered -- said stay.\n\n\'I was at a warren clearance,\' she said. \'Three years ago. Eastern hills. I will not name it because naming it makes it real and I spend every night trying to make it unreal.\'\n\nHe did not speak. His hands were flat on the bar, very still.\n\n\'I followed orders. I carried a torch. I... did what soldiers do. And then I heard--\' She stopped. She stared at her drink. \'I heard a child. Screaming. In the tunnels. And I kept walking. Because orders. Because duty. Because the empire said they were vermin and I believed the empire because believing was easier than thinking.\'\n\nShe looked at him. Her eyes were red and wet and steady.\n\n\'Your people burned my warren,\' he said. His voice was quiet. Not angry. Anger was a luxury that goblins could not afford.\n\n\'My people burned my conscience,\' she said. \'I am not asking for forgiveness. I do not deserve it. I am telling you because you deserve to hear a soldier say: we were wrong. I was wrong. And I am sorry.\'\n\nThe tavern was noisy around them. Card games. Laughter. The ordinary sounds of people who had not burned anything.\n\n\'Sorry does not rebuild warrens,\' he said.\n\n\'No. It does not.\'\n\n\'Sorry does not bring back the dead.\'\n\n\'No.\'\n\n\'Then what good is it?\'\n\n\'None,\' she said. \'Except that it is true. And in my experience, true things are rare enough to be worth something, even when they do not fix anything.\'\n\nHe left the tavern. He carried her words for six months, turning them over the way you turn over a strange stone found in the road -- examining them from every angle, testing their weight, trying to determine whether they were genuine or just another imperial trick.\n\nHe found her again. Not by accident. He asked. He searched. He used the resistance\'s network to track a deserter in the borderlands, which was a misuse of resources that his cell leader would have objected to if he had asked permission, which he did not.\n\nShe was in another tavern. Different town. Same drink. Same stare.\n\n\'I have been thinking about what you said,\' he told her.\n\n\'I have been thinking about it for three years.\'\n\n\'Sorry does not fix anything.\'\n\n\'I know.\'\n\n\'But you meant it.\'\n\n\'Yes.\'\n\n\'That is rare. Among your people, that is very rare.\'\n\nHe sat down. She looked at him. He looked at her. Two broken people in a place designed for strangers, and neither of them strangers anymore.\n\n\'The resistance needs couriers,\' he said. \'People who can move through imperial territory without being noticed. A human woman, civilian, unremarkable -- you could carry messages that a goblin cannot.\'\n\n\'You are asking me to work for the goblin resistance.\'\n\n\'I am asking you to do something that matters. You said you followed orders because it was easier than thinking. I am asking you to think.\'\n\nShe thought. For a long time. Then she set down her drink -- the last drink, as it turned out -- and said: \'Tell me what you need.\'\n\nShe became a courier. She carried messages between cells, through checkpoints that stopped goblins but waved humans through, past garrisons that she had once served in, through a country that she had once believed was righteous and now understood was cruel.\n\nShe and Quill worked together for four years before she said: \'I have not had a drink since the night you found me the second time.\'\n\n\'I know.\'\n\n\'I have not had a nightmare in six months.\'\n\n\'I know that too.\'\n\n\'It is because of the work. Doing something right after doing something wrong -- it does not erase the wrong. But it gives the hands something to hold besides guilt.\'\n\n\'It is not just the work,\' he said.\n\nShe looked at him. He looked at her.\n\n\'No,\' she agreed. \'It is not just the work.\'\n\nForgiveness did not arrive in a single moment. It arrived in pieces, over years, carried by small acts of trust -- a message delivered, a warning passed, a life saved. It arrived in the silences between missions, when they sat together and the past was present but no longer poisonous. It arrived in the understanding that guilt and love could coexist in the same heart, and that the heart was large enough for both.\n\nThey did not forgive the empire. The empire had not asked. But they forgave each other, and themselves, and that was enough to build something in the ruins.\n\nThe resistance and the road. The warren and the conscience. Two people who had every reason to be enemies and chose, against all logic and all history, to be more.'

    content: 'ASTRONOMY SECT ARCHIVE — RESTRICTED CIRCULATION\nObservation Report, Year 0 AAW (After Annihilation of the West)\nStation: Mount Ceres Observatory, Eastern Range\n\nThe sky brightened. Our instruments recorded a pulse of energy that defied classification. When the light faded, Calidar was ash. Rivers that had flowed for millennia vanished from our charts.\n\nWe must be precise, for precision is all we have left.\n\nAt the fourteenth hour of the summer solstice, our heliographic plates detected a luminous anomaly originating from no discernible celestial body. The pulse lasted approximately eleven seconds. In that interval, every instrument in the observatory redlined simultaneously. Three mercury barometers shattered. The great lens cracked along its eastern axis, a flaw it retains to this day.\n\nThe pulse did not behave as light. It did not travel in a wavefront. Our triangulation stations in Vel\'mara and Keth\'salor recorded it at the same instant — not with the expected delay of distance. Whatever this energy was, it did not propagate. It simply was, everywhere at once, and then it was not.\n\nWhen we turned our instruments westward the following dawn, the Calidar basin registered no thermal signature. This is not what one expects after a conflagration of such magnitude. Fire leaves heat. Volcanism leaves heat. Even the dying of stars leaves a residual warmth that persists for centuries. Calidar was cold. Colder than the surrounding terrain. As though the energy had not merely destroyed but had consumed — had taken the warmth of the land itself as fuel or as payment.\n\nThe rivers Shal and Vel\'uin, which we had charted flowing westward into the Calidar delta for over four hundred years of continuous observation, simply ceased. Not diverted. Not evaporated. The water table itself had dropped below any measurable depth. Geological survey teams later confirmed that the aquifer beneath the region had been fused shut, its porous stone compressed into a seamless crystalline mass.\n\nWe submitted our findings to the Sect Council. The report was accepted, classified, and sealed. We were instructed to recalibrate our instruments and resume normal observation. No further investigation was authorized.\n\nWe are astronomers. We measure what the sky reveals. But I confess that in eight hundred years of record-keeping, the sky has never revealed anything that left us afraid to look upward.\n\nSomething pointed at Calidar. Something with the precision of a cartographer and the power of a dying sun. We measured its aftermath. We cannot measure its origin. And that, I fear, is precisely the point.'

Forgive everything, if it comes to that.\n\nI have found references to something called the Atlas. Not a book of maps, as you might assume.

The Vel\'sharath archives that survived the burning — the ones the Council claims were corrupted by void influence — I have read fragments. Translated fragments, granted, and poor translations at that. But what the Vel\'sharath were studying was not void magic. It was not corruption. It was cartography. Sacred cartography. They believed the heavens could be mapped not merely as points of light but as a mechanism. A great instrument. And they believed that instrument could be aimed.\n\nI found the term in three separate sources: Kel\'thana vos Atalar. The closest translation I can manage is "the Atlas of Heaven\'s Hand" or perhaps "Heaven\'s Pointing Atlas." The grammar is unusual — the possessive form implies the heavens themselves possess agency. The Atlas does not map the heavens. The heavens map through the Atlas. Do you understand the distinction? The heavens are the cartographer. The Atlas is the pen.\n\nAnd someone used it.\n\nThe energy readings from the Astronomy Sect — I obtained a copy through channels I will not name — describe an event that cannot be explained by any known force. Not arcane. Not divine. Not mechanical. Something else entirely. Something that operates on a scale we do not have words for.\n\nI believe the Vel\'sharath found it. I believe they understood what it was. And I believe that is the real reason Calidar was destroyed — not as a demonstration of power, but as an act of silencing.\n\nI am traveling to the eastern archives tomorrow. If I do not write again within a fortnight, assume the worst. Destroy this letter. Tell no one what I have told you.\n\nYour brother in knowledge,\nAldric\n\n[The remainder of the page is torn away.

The sand has fused to glass in patterns that suggest unimaginable heat. We found no bodies — not because they were removed, but because nothing remained to find.\n\nDay 1: We entered the wastes from the eastern approach, following the old trade road from Keth\'salor. The road simply ends. Not crumbled. Not buried. The paving stones are fused into the glass substrate as though they melted and then froze in the same instant. Our geologist, Tavar, estimates the heat required would exceed the core temperature of a forge-mountain by a factor of thirty. He asked me not to include that figure in the official report. He said it would not be believed.\n\nDay 3: We reached what our old maps indicate was the city center of Vel\'athis, the Calidar capital. There is nothing. I do not mean ruins. I do not mean rubble. I mean nothing. The ground is a flat plane of dark glass stretching to every horizon. When the sun strikes it at certain angles, you can see colors trapped within — deep blues, greens, the amber of what might once have been wood or bone. The city is not gone. It is beneath our feet. Compressed. Fused. A civilization pressed flat and sealed under glass like a specimen in a naturalist\'s collection.\n\nDay 5: Tavar broke through the surface layer at a point where the glass was thinnest. Beneath it he found a stratum of crystallized material that defied analysis. It was notite stone, notite metal, not glass. Under magnification it appeared to contain structures — repeating geometric patterns too regular to be natural, too alien to be architectural. He sealed the sample and refused to discuss it further.\n\nDay 7: Three members of the expedition reported nightmares. The same nightmare. A hand descending from a clear sky. A finger extended. A sound like the world inhaling. Physician Calleth attributed it to stress and the desolate environment. I am not certain she believes her own diagnosis.\n\nDay 9: We turned back. Not because we were ordered to. Not because we ran low on supplies. We turned back because on the ninth morning, we found footprints in the glass that had not been there the night before. Bare feet. Walking in a circle. The prints were melted into the surface as though whoever made them was hot enough to soften glass with their steps.\n\nThere was nothing alive in those wastes. I am certain of this.\n\nI am also certain that something was there.\n\nRecommendation: Seal the eastern approach. Discourage further expeditions. Mark the region as unstable and uninhabitable. Do not, under any circumstances, attempt excavation.'

    content: 'HIGH COUNCIL ARCHIVE DIVISION\nAccess Log and Incident Report — File 447-C\nClassification: ABSOLUTE — High Council Eyes Only\n\nFile 447-C has been removed by order of the High Council. Three archivists who accessed this file have since died under unclear circumstances. This incident report is maintained as a warning.\n\nChronology of Events:\n\nYear 823 AAW — Archivist Donal Keth, during routine cataloguing of the Restricted Section, discovered File 447-C misfiled among agricultural census records from the pre-war period. The file bore no classification markings, which Archivist Keth noted as anomalous for a document of its apparent age and content. He logged the discovery per standard protocol and began a preliminary review.\n\nArchivist Keth\'s notes, recovered after his death, indicate the file contained original Vel\'sharath documents — not translations, not copies, but primary source material written in the Calidar script. He described diagrams of "extraordinary complexity" depicting what he interpreted as stellar configurations overlaid with geometric constructions. He noted that certain diagrams appeared to show the same stellar configuration from multiple angles simultaneously, as though the cartographer had occupied several positions in space at once.\n\nYear 823, Month 7 — Archivist Keth was found dead in his quarters. Cause of death was recorded as heart failure. He was forty-one years old and in good health. His personal notes on File 447-C were discovered during the inventory of his effects.\n\nYear 824 — Archivist Sera Voss, assigned to investigate Keth\'s cataloguing backlog, located and accessed File 447-C. She made copies of three pages before the file was recalled by the High Council. She was found dead seven weeks later. Cause of death: fall from the archive tower. The door to the tower was locked from the outside.\n\nYear 824, Month 11 — Archivist Tomas Fell, who had assisted Voss in her work and admitted to reading portions of the file, requested transfer to a provincial archive. Transfer was approved. He never arrived at his new posting. His traveling party reported that he left camp during the night. Search parties found no trace. His horse and belongings were undisturbed.\n\nYear 825 — File 447-C was removed from the archive by agents of the High Council. Its current location is unknown. All copies made by Archivist Voss were confiscated and presumably destroyed.\n\nAssessment: Three deaths in two years, all connected to a single file. Coincidence is not a satisfactory explanation. Either the file itself poses some direct hazard — arcane contamination, memetic corruption, or similar — or someone is ensuring that its contents do not become known.\n\nBoth possibilities are deeply troubling.\n\nThis incident report is to remain in the Restricted Section as a standing warning. Any future discovery of materials related to File 447-C is to be reported directly to the High Council. Under no circumstances is the material to be read, copied, or discussed.\n\nThe archive preserves knowledge. But some knowledge, it seems, refuses to be preserved without cost.'

Year unknown, estimated 200-300 AAW.\n\nWe watched the stars shift. We recorded the impossible. And then we stopped recording. The silence protects.\n\nI write this for no audience. I write this because the weight of what we know has become unbearable, and I am old, and old men are permitted their indulgences.\n\nOn the night of the Calidar Event, the stars moved. Not as they move in their normal courses — the slow, stately procession we have charted for centuries. They moved as a flock of birds moves when a predator passes overhead. A flinching. A collective recoil. As though the stars themselves were afraid.\n\nWe recorded it. Every observatory in the eastern hemisphere captured the same data. For eleven seconds, the fixed stars were not fixed. Constellations that had held their shapes since before recorded history distorted, compressed, and then snapped back into place. The variance was tiny — fractions of a degree — but it was real and it was simultaneous and it should not have been possible.\n\nThe implications are staggering. The stars are not lanterns hung upon a dome. They are vast and distant and unimaginably massive. For them to move — even slightly, even briefly — would require a force that beggars comprehension. A force that could grip the architecture of the heavens themselves and bend it.\n\nWe reported our findings to the Sect Council. The Council convened in emergency session. Three days of deliberation behind closed doors. When they emerged, they issued a single directive: all records of the stellar displacement were to be sealed. The official observation logs for that night were to be rewritten to show normal stellar positions. Any astronomer who discussed the displacement outside the Sect would be expelled.\n\nI asked the Council Chair why. She looked at me with eyes that I had never seen afraid before.\n\n"Because if we publish what we observed," she said, "someone will ask what caused it. And if someone determines what caused it, someone will try to cause it again."\n\nShe was right. Of course she was right.\n\nSo we stopped recording. We rewrote our logs. We taught our apprentices that the night of the Calidar Event was unremarkable from an astronomical perspective. We lied.\n\nEight hundred years of silence. Eight hundred years of astronomers training new astronomers to ignore the most significant celestial event in history. The Sect\'s greatest achievement is not what we have discovered. It is what we have successfully hidden.\n\nThe stars flinched. Something made the heavens themselves recoil in fear.\n\nAnd we pretend we did not see it.\n\nMay whoever finds this understand why we chose silence. May they also choose it.'

They wrote the location on their walls. They were preparing an expedition to retrieve it when someone decided the knowledge was too dangerous to exist."\n\nHe named a price. It was modest — absurdly so for what he claimed. I declined. Not because of the cost.

The innkeeper said he had not checked out. His bed had not been slept in. The leather tube was gone.\n\nI have thought about that night every day for eleven years. I do not know if the old man was telling the truth. I do not know if his map was real. But I know this: something about the way he spoke made the hair on my neck stand up.

    content: 'ENGINEERING ANALYSIS DIVISION\nReport 447-X: Thermodynamic Analysis of the Calidar Event\nClassification: Internal — Do Not Distribute\nYear: 614 AAW\n\nOur calculations suggest the energy required to cause the observed destruction exceeds any known mechanism by several orders of magnitude. Either our physics is incomplete, or something exists that operates outside physical law.\n\nPreamble: This report was commissioned by the Engineering Guild Council following a request from the Holy Dominion\'s Ministry of Historical Assessment. We were asked to provide a technical analysis of the Calidar Event using modern engineering principles. What follows is our honest assessment. We suspect it is not the assessment they wanted.\n\nAnalysis:\n\nThe Calidar basin encompasses approximately 4,200 square leagues. The entirety of this area has been fused to glass to a depth that varies between three and forty meters. The glass is uniform in composition, suggesting a single instantaneous event rather than a prolonged process.\n\nTo fuse silicate sand to glass requires temperatures exceeding 1,700 degrees. To fuse it to the observed depth across the observed area would require an energy output approximately equal to the total output of every forge, furnace, and arcane engine in the known world operating continuously for seven hundred years. Concentrated into eleven seconds.\n\nThis is not possible through any mechanism we understand. We have considered and eliminated the following:\n\n- Volcanic eruption: insufficient energy, wrong thermal profile, no magmatic residue.\n- Arcane detonation: the largest recorded arcane event (the Siege of Vel\'mara, Year 344 BW) produced roughly one ten-thousandth of the required energy.\n- Divine intervention: while theoretically unlimited in energy, divine events leave characteristic residual signatures. None were detected.\n- Meteorite impact: wrong crater profile, no impact ejecta, no atmospheric disruption consistent with bolide entry.\n\nWhat remains is a paradox. The event happened — the evidence is incontrovertible. But it cannot have happened — no known process can account for it.\n\nWe are left with two possibilities. The first is that our understanding of physics is fundamentally incomplete, and there exist mechanisms of energy release that we have not yet theorized. The second is that whatever caused the Calidar Event is not a natural phenomenon at all, but an artifact or instrument of such sophistication that it operates on principles we cannot yet comprehend.\n\nThe Division is reluctant to endorse the second possibility, as it implies the existence of a weapon capable of destroying civilizations on command. However, intellectual honesty compels us to note that it is the more parsimonious explanation. An unknown natural phenomenon requires us to postulate entirely new physics. An unknown artifact requires only that someone, at some point, was cleverer than we are.\n\nGiven the Vel\'sharath\'s documented achievements in mathematics, astronomy, and theoretical arcana, this is not as implausible as we would prefer.\n\nRecommendation: Further research into Vel\'sharath theoretical frameworks. We understand that political considerations may make this difficult. We submit the recommendation nonetheless.\n\n[Margin note in different hand: "Recommendation denied. File and forget. — Council Chair"]'

We saw a civilization of [ILLEGIBLE] million souls cease to exist in the span of a breath. We felt the ground shake and the rivers die and the air itself scream with a voice that was not a voice. We saw the hand of something [ILLEGIBLE] reach down from a clear sky and press the world flat.\n\nWe survived because we were outside the radius. By thirty leagues.

We carry it so that others need not.\n\n[Several paragraphs are completely illegible]\n\n...and should the Atlas be found, the bearer is to be [ILLEGIBLE] without hesitation and without mercy.

They say shapes move beneath the fused sand. They say they hear whispers in languages no living creature uses. This report compiles their testimony.\n\nI want to state clearly that I am not a superstitious man. I have worked the perimeter zone for twelve years, cataloguing mineral deposits in the regions adjacent to the Calidar wastes. The glass field itself is under interdiction, but the surrounding territory is rich in unusual crystalline formations — a byproduct, we assume, of the event\'s thermal radiation. These crystals fetch good prices from alchemists and artificers. That is why we are here. Profit, not curiosity.\n\nBut the prospectors talk. And after twelve years, I have heard enough consistent testimony to feel obligated to file this report.\n\nThe singing: Multiple independent witnesses describe a low harmonic tone that emanates from the glass field after sundown. It is not wind. The tone persists on still nights. It is not animal. No creature inhabits the wastes. The tone has been described as "a choir heard from very far away" and "a single note that contains other notes, like light through a prism." One prospector, a former musician, claimed to identify intervals in the tone that do not correspond to any known musical scale.\n\nThe shapes: At dawn and dusk, when the sun strikes the glass at low angles, observers report seeing movement beneath the surface. Not shadows — movement. Dark forms that glide slowly, as though swimming through the fused substrate. They follow no pattern. They do not respond to sound or vibration. One prospector shattered the surface glass with a hammer and found nothing beneath but more glass. The shapes, he said, had moved away before he struck.\n\nThe whispers: This is the testimony I find most disturbing. Prospectors who camp within a league of the glass field report hearing voices during the deepest hours of night. Not shouts. Not screams. Whispers. Soft, insistent, and in a language that none of them recognize. One prospector — an educated woman who speaks four languages — said the whispers had grammatical structure. They were not random sounds. Someone, or something, was speaking.\n\nShe also said she understood a single word. She would not tell me what it was. She quit the guild the following week and moved to the far coast. I have not been able to reach her since.\n\nI do not know what is happening in the Calidar wastes. I do not know if the glass preserves something, or contains something, or if the event that created it left behind some residue that our science cannot explain. But I know that brave, practical, unimaginative people are frightened. And I know that frightened prospectors do not frighten easily.\n\nSomething is wrong in that place. Something that eight hundred years has not healed.'

By whose authority? The records do not say. We preserve everything — except, it seems, this.\n\nI have served this archive for one hundred and sixty years. In that time I have catalogued the rise and fall of dynasties, the texts of forgotten religions, the love letters of kings and the death warrants of traitors. We have preserved it all, without judgment, without censorship, because that is what an archive does. We are the memory of civilization. We do not choose what to remember.\n\nAnd yet someone has chosen for us.\n\nThe gaps are not subtle. Our cross-reference index lists seventeen documents by title, author, and date of acquisition that should be present in the Calidar collection. The shelving locations are recorded. The preservation notes are recorded. In three cases, the documents were checked out by named scholars and the return dates are logged. But the documents themselves are gone.\n\nI have searched every shelf, every misfile bin, every restoration queue. They are not misfiled. They are not damaged and awaiting repair. They are gone.\n\nThe removal was professional. No damage to adjacent materials. No disruption to the filing system. Whoever did this knew our protocols intimately. They knew which documents to take and they knew how to take them without leaving evidence of forced entry or tampering. The only reason we know they are missing at all is because they did not — or could not — alter the cross-reference index, which is maintained in a separate, warded vault.\n\nI have made inquiries. Discreet inquiries, because something about this situation makes me reluctant to be loud. The Council\'s administrative office claims no knowledge of any authorized removal. The Intelligence Sect liaison smiled at me in a way that was not reassuring and suggested I focus on "areas of greater scholarly productivity."\n\nI am not a fool. I know what a warning looks like.\n\nBut I am an archivist, and I will not pretend that seventeen documents vanished of their own accord. I am therefore entering this memorandum into the permanent record as a formal notation of loss. The following documents are missing:\n\n[A list of seventeen titles follows, each with acquisition date and shelf location. Notable titles include: "Vel\'sharath Astronomical Correspondence (Fragment)," "Analysis of Thermal Residue from the Western Basin," "Testimony of Survivor K. (Transcription)," and "Cartographic Anomalies in Pre-War Calidar Celestial Charts."]\n\nI do not know who took these documents. I do not know why. But I know that an archive with deliberate gaps is not an archive. It is a story someone is editing. And edited stories are, by definition, lies.\n\nI will not participate in a lie. If this memorandum also vanishes, then at least someone will notice the gap it leaves behind. Gaps, after all, are what I am trained to find.\n\nCaelen Mirathis\nSenior Archivist, 160th Year of Service\n\n[A handwritten note at the bottom, in different ink: "This memorandum was nearly removed in Year 843.

Even the dead fear to witness it twice.\n\nYou want to know what the spirits say about the glass lands to the west. Fine. I will tell you, outsider, because you have brought good tobacco and because the spirits are restless tonight and perhaps speaking of it will quiet them.\n\nThe steppe folk were here before the elves built their cities of crystal and song. We were here when Calidar was just a river delta where the fish were fat and the soil was rich. We watched them build. We watched them study their stars and draw their maps and speak to the sky in languages that made the grass lie flat. We did not understand what they were doing. We did not care. They left us alone, and we left them alone, and the steppe is wide enough for all.\n\nThen the sky broke.\n\nMy grandmother\'s grandmother was a young rider on the eastern steppe when it happened. She said the horizon went white. Not bright — white. The color itself was wrong. Light has warmth. This was cold white, like bone, like salt, like the belly of a dead fish. It lasted for a count of ten breaths and then it was gone, and where Calidar had been there was silence.\n\nNot quiet. Silence. The wind stopped. The insects stopped. The birds fell from the sky — not dead, but stunned, as though the world had hiccupped and they had forgotten how to fly. Everything held still for one terrible moment, as though the land itself was waiting to see if it would be next.\n\nMy grandmother\'s grandmother rode west the next day. She said the grass ended in a line as clean as a knife cut. On one side, the steppe. On the other, glass. Flat, dark, warm glass that stretched to the horizon. She said she could see colors in it — the ghosts of trees, of buildings, of rivers. Everything that had been, pressed flat and sealed like a flower in a book.\n\nShe turned back. She told no one what she had seen for thirty years. When she finally spoke of it, it was to her granddaughter, my grandmother, and she wept as she spoke.\n\nThe spirits of the steppe do not go near the glass lands. I have asked them. I have begged them. They refuse. The spirits of the dead are not easily frightened — they have already died, after all, what more can be done to them? But they will not go west. They say that what happened there was not death. Death they understand. Death they can navigate.\n\nWhat happened to Calidar was something else. Something that the dead have no word for. An unmaking. A removal. As though the land and everything on it was not destroyed but simply subtracted from the world, and the glass is what rushed in to fill the absence.\n\nThe ancestors showed me this in a dream, and in the dream I saw the instrument that did it. I will not describe it. The dream lasted only a moment, but that moment was enough to understand that some things are too large for mortal minds to hold.\n\nI woke screaming. My apprentice said I screamed for an hour.\n\nDo not go to the glass lands, outsider. There is nothing there for you. There is nothing there for anyone. Only the memory of what was taken, singing in the dark.'

He claimed to have found the truth. He requested an audience with the High Temple. He never arrived. His quarters were empty. His notes were ash.\n\nI write this record against explicit instruction from the Temple Prior, who has ordered that Brother Aldric\'s name be struck from our rolls and his tenure treated as though it never occurred. I will not comply. Aldric was my colleague, my friend, and the most brilliant scholar this Temple has produced in three centuries. He deserves a record, even if it must be hidden.\n\nAldric came to the Temple at age nineteen, already fluent in seven languages including two dead ones. He was assigned to the Historical Analysis division, where he quickly distinguished himself through his work on pre-war civilizations. His particular obsession was Calidar.\n\nFor forty years he traveled, corresponded, bribed, and bargained his way into every archive, private collection, and ruin that might contain information about the Calidar event. He was turned away more often than he was admitted. He was threatened twice — once by Imperial agents, once by individuals he would not identify. He persisted.\n\nI received letters from him throughout his research. They grew increasingly urgent over the final years. He spoke of patterns — connections between the Vel\'sharath\'s astronomical research and certain pre-war theological texts that described the heavens as "a mechanism of address." He believed the Vel\'sharath had discovered a way to interface with this mechanism. Not through magic. Not through prayer. Through mathematics.\n\n"They found the coordinates, Maren," he wrote in his final letter. "Not of a place. Of a function. The heavens are not merely above us. They are a system. And the Atlas is the key to that system. A way to speak to the sky in its own language and tell it: there. That point. Remove it."\n\nHe said he had assembled the complete picture from fragments scattered across a dozen archives. He said he knew what the Atlas was, where it had been created, and — most terrifyingly — that it had not been destroyed after Calidar. It had been hidden. By someone who wanted to use it again.\n\nHe requested an audience with the High Temple to present his findings. The audience was granted for the first day of the new month.\n\nHe never arrived.\n\nI went to his quarters myself. The door was unlocked. The room was immaculate — bed made, floor swept, personal effects neatly arranged. Everything was in order except his research. Forty years of notes, translations, maps, and correspondence.

Someone entered his quarters, destroyed his life\'s work, and removed him. Whether he is alive or dead I do not know. I fear the answer.\n\nThe Temple Prior says Aldric left voluntarily, pursuing a personal matter. This is a lie. I know it is a lie. The Prior knows I know it is a lie. And yet the lie persists, because the alternative — that a scholar can be disappeared from within a Temple of the Silver Word for asking the wrong questions — is too frightening to acknowledge.\n\nAldric, if you are alive and somehow reading this: I kept your last letter.

    content: 'GUILD COUNCIL ARCHIVE — SEALED SECTION\nDocument Classification: Eyes of the Stone Council Only\nOrigin: Deep Warren, Hall of Echoes\nYear: Unknown (estimated 50-100 AAW based on linguistic analysis)\n\nThe surface folk whisper of a weapon. We do not whisper. We do not speak of it at all. The deep stone remembers the trembling. Once was enough. We sealed the shafts that faced east.\n\nLet it be recorded in the living stone that the dwarven holds felt the Calidar Event at a depth of three thousand fathoms. This should not be possible. Surface catastrophes — wars, eruptions, the occasional arcane detonation — do not penetrate beyond the first two hundred fathoms. Our deepest halls are immune to the tantrums of the upper world. This is why we dig. This is why we endure the dark and the pressure and the silence. Because the deep stone is safe.\n\nThe deep stone was not safe on that day.\n\nThe tremor came without warning. Not an earthquake — we know earthquakes, we have built in spite of them for millennia, our engineers can feel a fault shift from fifty leagues away. This was different. The stone did not shake. It rang. Like a bell struck by a hammer the size of the sky. A single pure tone that passed through every tunnel, every hall, every chamber in the western holds. It shattered crystal formations that had grown undisturbed for ten thousand years. It cracked walls that had been carved from living granite before the elves learned to write.\n\nThree holds collapsed. Two hundred and fourteen dwarves died — crushed, buried, drowned when underground rivers shifted course in an instant. We do not speak their names above ground. Their names are carved in the Hall of Echoes, where the stone still hums with the memory of that tone.\n\nOur geologists studied the event for decades. Their conclusion was unanimous and deeply unsettling: the tremor did not originate from any geological source. It came from above. From the surface. From the sky, if their calculations are correct. Something struck the surface of the world with such force that the impact propagated through the planetary crust and into the mantle itself. The stone rang because the entire world rang, from surface to core, like a sphere of crystal struck by a god\'s finger.\n\nWe sent observers to the surface. They reported the glass wastes. They reported the silence. They reported that the sky above Calidar seemed wrong — too wide, too empty, as though something that should have been there was missing.\n\nThe Stone Council convened. The discussion lasted forty days. At its conclusion, the following orders were issued:\n\nAll shafts, tunnels, and ventilation passages facing the Calidar wastes are to be permanently sealed with fused stone. No exceptions.\n\nNo dwarf is to travel to, through, or above the Calidar wastes for any purpose.\n\nNo dwarf is to discuss the tremor, its cause, or its effects with any surface-dwelling individual or organization.\n\nThe term used by surface folk — "Heaven\'s Atlas" — is forbidden within the holds. Any dwarf who uses this term will face the Stone Council\'s judgment.\n\nThese orders stand in perpetuity.\n\nWe are a practical people. We do not fear what we can understand. Earthquakes, cave-ins, magma intrusions — these we understand. These we can engineer against.\n\nWe cannot engineer against a weapon that makes the bones of the world ring like a bell. We cannot dig deep enough to escape something that reaches the mantle. If the deep stone is not safe, then nowhere is safe.\n\nSo we seal. We silence. We forget, as best we can.\n\nAnd we pray — to the stone, to the dark, to whatever listens in the deep places — that whatever hand struck that blow has been stilled. Because if it strikes again, there is no hold deep enough, no wall thick enough, no stone strong enough to shelter us.\n\nThe mountain remembers. The mountain is afraid.\n\nSo are we.'

    content: 'ON THE DIVINE RIGHT OF EXPANSION\nBy Prelate Aldric Solvane, Year 839\nIssued under the authority of the Luminary Inquest\n\nHelios has blessed this empire with purpose. Where the light does not reach, we carry it. This is not conquest -- it is salvation. To deny this truth is to deny the sun itself, and no sane mind would argue against the dawn.\n\nThe Holy Dominion does not expand for land. We do not march for gold. We march because Helios commands that all peoples live under His radiance, and those who dwell in darkness -- whether by ignorance or defiance -- suffer a spiritual malady that only we can cure. The territories we claim are not stolen. They are liberated from the shadow.\n\nConsider the eastern marches before imperial stewardship. Goblin warrens riddled the hills like disease through flesh. Orc raiders burned what little the local peoples managed to cultivate. Banditry was law. Starvation was commonplace. The empire brought roads. The empire brought granaries. The empire brought the Liturgy of the Dawn, and with it, order.\n\nCritics within our own borders -- and there are always critics, for Helios tests faith through doubt -- argue that expansion strains our legions and our treasury. They present figures. They cite logistics. They miss the point entirely. The treasury exists to serve the faith, not the reverse. A rich empire that hoards its light behind walls is no better than a miser who lets his neighbors starve while his granary overflows.\n\nThe elves counsel patience. They always counsel patience. They have counseled patience for a thousand years while darkness spread and peoples suffered. Patience is the virtue of those who have no urgency, and the elves have never been urgent about anything except their own survival. We do not have the luxury of millennia. Helios demands action in this lifetime, not the next.\n\nTo every governor, every garrison commander, every prelate who reads this: expansion is not a policy choice. It is a moral obligation. The territories beyond our borders contain souls -- human, and otherwise -- who live without the light. Every year we delay is a year those souls remain in darkness.\n\nSome will resist. The orcs resist because they know nothing else. The goblins resist because they are creatures of the dark places and the light burns them. Even some humans resist, having grown comfortable in their ignorance. Resistance does not invalidate the mission. A physician does not abandon a patient because the patient thrashes during treatment.\n\nThe Dominion will expand because it must. Helios wills it. History demands it. The alternative -- a world where darkness and disorder reign unchecked -- is unacceptable to any faithful citizen.\n\nLet the light spread. Let the borders grow. Let no corner of this world remain untouched by His radiance.\n\nIn Helios\'s name, so it is written.\nIn Helios\'s name, so it shall be done.'

    content: 'THE GOBLIN QUESTION: A POLICY ANALYSIS\nClassified -- Imperial Archive, Year 844\nPrepared for the High Council by the Bureau of Territorial Governance\n\nExtermination has proven expensive. Containment has proven impossible. This document proposes a third option: strategic neglect of non-productive territories.\n\nFor sixty years, the Dominion has pursued two alternating strategies regarding goblin populations in imperial territory. The first, favored by military commanders, is extermination through warren clearance operations. The second, favored by provincial governors, is containment through garrison networks and patrol routes. Both have failed. This analysis explains why, and proposes an alternative.\n\nEXTERMINATION: THE NUMBERS\nThe Eastern Goblin Campaigns of 831-834 cleared forty-seven warrens across three provinces. Cost: twelve thousand soldiers killed or permanently injured, eight million gold in direct military expenditure, and an estimated fourteen million gold in economic disruption to the regions involved. Result: within one year, forty-seven new warrens had appeared, often in more defensible positions than the originals. Goblin population estimates returned to pre-campaign levels within three years. The campaign accomplished nothing except to radicalize previously neutral goblin communities and create a generation of resistance fighters with personal grievances against the empire.\n\nCONTAINMENT: THE NUMBERS\nGarrison networks in the western provinces maintain an average of one soldier per two hundred meters of contested border. Annual cost: four million gold per province. Effectiveness: goblin incursions reduced by approximately thirty percent in garrisoned areas, but increased by approximately forty percent in adjacent ungarrisoned areas. The goblins do not stop. They relocate. Containment is a game of displacement, not prevention, and we are paying four million gold per province per year to play it.\n\nTHE THIRD OPTION: STRATEGIC NEGLECT\nThis bureau proposes that the Dominion withdraw active military operations from territories that meet all three of the following criteria: goblin population density exceeds imperial civilian population density; resource extraction value is below five thousand gold annually; and terrain makes conventional military operations cost-prohibitive.\n\nThis is not surrender. It is resource allocation. The legions currently committed to chasing goblins through unprofitable hill country would be better deployed on the northern border, where the orc clans represent an actual existential threat. The gold currently spent on warren clearance would be better invested in fortifying productive territories.\n\nLet the goblins have their hills. They will raid, as they always have, but raiding can be managed through local militia at a fraction of the cost of military campaigns. The empire loses nothing of value and gains everything that those misallocated legions and misallocated gold could provide elsewhere.\n\nANTICIPATED OBJECTIONS\nThe Luminary Inquest will object that abandoning territory contradicts the doctrine of expansion. We note that the doctrine requires spreading light to all peoples, not maintaining permanent military occupation of every cave system on the continent. The light can wait for some caves.\n\nMilitary commanders will object that withdrawal signals weakness. We note that spending twelve thousand lives and eight million gold to accomplish nothing signals something far worse than weakness. It signals incompetence.\n\nThis bureau recommends immediate adoption of the strategic neglect framework.\n\nFiled and sealed. Distribution restricted to High Council members only.'

    content: 'MILITARY READINESS AGAINST THE ORC THREAT\nLuminary Inquest Strategic Assessment, Year 846\nDistributed to all garrison commanders, northern provinces\n\nThe clans are fragmented. This is temporary. Every garrison commander must understand: the orcs do not need to grow stronger. They only need to unite again.\n\nThe Great Khan\'s unification war remains the single largest military catastrophe in Dominion history. In thirty years, the united clans conquered more territory than the empire had claimed in three centuries. Our legions -- the finest in the known world -- broke against their riders on open ground. We held because of walls, not because of martial superiority, and every commander who tells himself otherwise is a danger to the soldiers under his command.\n\nThe current fragmentation of the orc clans into competing warbands is not evidence of orc weakness. It is evidence of the absence of a unifying leader. The clans fight each other because they have no common enemy compelling enough to override their rivalries. The moment such a leader emerges -- and history suggests it is a matter of when, not if -- the clans will consolidate with a speed that will shock anyone who has grown complacent.\n\nCURRENT THREAT ASSESSMENT\nTwelve major clans operate north of the Ashmark. Six have demonstrated the ability to field more than five thousand riders. Three -- the Iron Tusk, the Stormborn, and the Red Banner -- have engaged in joint operations within the last decade. Intelligence suggests ongoing marriage alliances between the Iron Tusk and Stormborn leadership. This is how unification begins.\n\nORC MILITARY CAPABILITIES\nThe empire\'s advantages are infrastructure, logistics, and defensive fortification. The orcs\'s advantages are mobility, individual combat prowess, and a warrior culture that produces soldiers from birth. On open ground, orc heavy cavalry will defeat imperial heavy infantry in nearly every engagement. This is not opinion. This is the conclusion of every after-action report from the Third Orc War.\n\nOur strategy must therefore be defensive in nature: deny the orcs open-field engagements, force them to assault fortified positions, and use our logistical superiority to outlast their campaign seasons. The orcs cannot sustain prolonged sieges. Their supply lines depend on raiding, and raiding becomes impossible when there is nothing left to raid behind fortress walls.\n\nREQUIRED ACTIONS\nAll northern garrisons must maintain full combat readiness at all times, not merely during traditional raiding seasons. The orcs have attacked outside expected windows three times in the last twenty years. Complacency kills.\n\nGarrison stores must be sufficient for a minimum ninety-day siege without resupply. Current inspections reveal that fewer than half of northern fortifications meet this standard. This is unacceptable.\n\nCavalry reserves must be expanded. We cannot match the orcs rider for rider, but we must be able to screen our supply lines and pursue raiding parties that breach the garrison line.\n\nThe northern border is not quiet. It is waiting. Prepare accordingly.\n\nBy order of the Luminary Inquest, this assessment carries the weight of imperial directive. Compliance is mandatory. Negligence will be treated as dereliction.'

    content: 'THE GNOMISH HERESY\nBy Prelate Verana Ashford, Year 842\nPresented to the Luminary Inquest, Restricted Circulation\n\nThey reject Helios. They reject hierarchy. They reject the natural order. When their secrets are revealed, they must be liberated from their errors.\n\nThe gnomish settlements on the western islands have long been dismissed by imperial strategists as irrelevant -- a minor people on minor islands, too distant and too small to warrant attention. This assessment is dangerously wrong. The gnomes represent the most comprehensive rejection of Helionic principles in the known world, and their continued existence is a theological threat that grows more dangerous with every year we ignore it.\n\nWhat we know of gnomish society comes from trade contacts, shipwrecked sailors, and a handful of gnomish exiles who have spoken -- reluctantly and incompletely -- about their homeland. The picture that emerges is deeply troubling.\n\nThe gnomes have no church. They have no priesthood. They acknowledge no divine authority whatsoever. In place of faith, they have placed their trust in mechanical philosophy -- the belief that the world operates according to fixed principles that can be discovered, measured, and exploited without divine intercession. They build machines that do the work of men. They claim to have harnessed forces that the Liturgy attributes solely to Helios\'s gift. They have, in short, constructed an entire civilization on the premise that the gods are unnecessary.\n\nWorse: they have no lords. No kings. No hierarchy of any kind that our contacts have been able to identify. They speak of councils and committees, of collective decisions and shared ownership. Every gnome, apparently, has equal voice in governance regardless of birth, achievement, or wisdom. This is not merely unusual. It is an abomination. Helios created hierarchy because hierarchy is the natural expression of His order -- the sun above the moon, the moon above the stars, the king above the lord, the lord above the commoner. To reject hierarchy is to reject creation itself.\n\nThe danger is not that the gnomes will attack us. They are too few and too cautious for that. The danger is that their ideas will spread. Already, dissident elements within the empire whisper about gnomish prosperity. They ask why gnomish citizens do not starve while imperial citizens do. They ask why gnomish communities require no beggars, no debtors\'s prisons, no charity from the church. These are seductive questions, and they have seductive answers -- answers that lead directly away from Helios and toward the mechanistic godlessness that the gnomes have embraced.\n\nWhen the empire eventually reaches the western islands -- and it will, as expansion is inevitable -- the Luminary Inquest must be prepared. The gnomes will not be converted by missionaries. They are too entrenched in their errors, too convinced of their own rationality. They will need to be shown, firmly and without ambiguity, that mechanical philosophy is insufficient. That their machines cannot replace divine purpose. That their councils cannot replace divine order.\n\nI recommend the Inquest begin preparing theological arguments now, while there is time. Study their machines. Understand their philosophy. Identify its weaknesses. When the moment comes, we must be ready to dismantle their heresy with the same precision they use to build their contraptions.\n\nHelios\'s light reaches everywhere, even the western islands. It is only a matter of time.'

    content: 'WHY WE DO NOT NEGOTIATE\nSpoken by Warlord Gash Ironteeth to the assembled clans, Year 840\nTranscribed by the Khan\'s Archive\n\nThe empire offers treaties. Treaties require trust. Trust requires honor. The empire has demonstrated neither. We remember every broken promise.\n\nI have lived sixty-three winters. In those winters, the empire has offered peace seven times. Seven times, we have sat across from their emissaries in their fine robes with their fine words and their fine promises. Seven times, we have been betrayed.\n\nThe first treaty I remember, I was a boy. My father\'s father sat with the imperial envoy. They agreed on borders. They marked the rivers and the ridges. Within two years, imperial settlers had crossed every line. When my grandfather protested, the envoy said the settlers were civilians, not soldiers, and therefore the treaty -- which spoke only of military forces -- had not been violated. My grandfather killed the envoy. The empire called this treachery. We called it justice.\n\nThe second treaty came after the war that followed. More fine words. More fine promises. This time they promised trade. They would buy our horses. They would sell us iron. The prices they offered were insults -- a quarter of what they charged each other. When we refused, they blockaded the mountain passes and called it commerce.\n\nI will not recount all seven. You know them. Your clans lived them. The pattern never changes. The empire offers peace when it is weak and breaks peace when it is strong. Their treaties are not agreements between equals. They are leashes, and they expect us to wear them gratefully.\n\nThe humans worship a sun god who tells them they are chosen. That every other people exists to serve them or be saved by them. You cannot negotiate with someone who believes their god has given them your land. Every treaty they offer is temporary -- a pause while they gather strength for the next expansion. They do not want peace. They want time.\n\nSome among us argue differently. They say the clans are weaker now than they were under the Great Khan. They say we need time too. They say a treaty would let us rebuild, rearm, reunify. They may be right about our weakness. They are wrong about the solution. A treaty does not pause the empire\'s growth. It accelerates it. Every year of peace is a year they build more walls, train more legions, push more settlers into the borderlands. A treaty does not buy us time. It sells our future.\n\nWe do not negotiate because negotiation requires a partner who keeps faith. We have tested this seven times. Seven times the empire has proven faithless. An eighth test would not prove wisdom. It would prove stupidity.\n\nRaid. Fight. Endure. These are the only honest relationships the empire offers us. At least in war, we know where we stand.\n\nThe steppe remembers. The clans remember. We will not forget.'

The clans squabble now, but the memory remains. When the sky darkens with banners again, we will ride as one.\n\nThis is the teaching of the First Unification, as it was told to me by my teacher, who received it from his, in an unbroken chain stretching back to those who rode beside the Great Khan himself.\n\nBefore the Khan, there were forty clans and forty feuds. The Iron Tusk fought the Stormborn over water rights. The Red Banner fought the Ash Wolves over grazing land. The Sky Riders fought everyone because fighting was what they did. Every summer brought raids. Every winter brought grudges. Every spring brought vengeance for the grudges. The cycle was old when the empire was young.\n\nThe Great Khan did not conquer the clans. This is the first thing the humans get wrong when they tell our history. The Khan challenged every warlord to single combat, yes. He won every challenge, yes. But he did not kill the defeated. He asked them one question: what do you want that fighting each other will never give you? And every warlord, once they were honest, gave the same answer: security. Safety for their herds. Safety for their families. A future that did not depend on whether the next clan over had a good harvest or a bad one.\n\nThe Khan gave them that. Under unification, clan territories were guaranteed by the Khan\'s own riders. Disputes were arbitrated, not fought. Trade routes were protected. For the first time in living memory, an orc child could grow up without learning to sleep with a weapon.\n\nThen the Khan turned the clans outward. Not for conquest -- this is the second thing the humans get wrong. The great campaigns were not wars of aggression. They were wars of prevention. The empire was expanding north. Every year, imperial settlers pushed further into the grasslands. Every year, the grazing land shrank. The Khan saw what the warlords, consumed by their feuds, had not: the empire would not stop. It would push and push until the clans had nowhere left to ride. The only answer was to push back so hard that the empire would never try again.\n\nIn thirty years, the united clans drove the empire back behind its original borders and beyond. We held territory from the Ashmark to the Silvercoast. We did not burn what we took. We did not massacre the populations. We taxed them fairly and protected them from bandits and from each other. The humans who lived under orc rule during the unification period were, by most accounts, better governed than they had been under imperial administration. The empire does not teach this in its histories.\n\nThe Khan died. His children fought over succession, as children do. The clans fractured. The empire reclaimed its territory. The cycle resumed.\n\nBut the lesson endures. We were one, and when we were one, we were unstoppable. The empire fears nothing more than another unification. They should. When the next Khan rises -- and one will rise, because the steppe always produces what it needs -- the clans will remember what unity gave them. They will remember the thirty years when no orc child slept afraid.\n\nPreserve this teaching. Copy it. Spread it. The doctrine of unification is not a memory. It is a promise.'

    content: 'ON THE WEAKNESS OF WALLS\nField Manual of Warlord Keth Stormborn, Year 843\nFor clan war-leaders and raid captains\n\nThey build castles. They build garrisons. They believe stone protects them. Stone cannot chase. Stone cannot pursue. This is their fundamental error, and it is the foundation of every tactic in this manual.\n\nThe humans love walls. They build them high and thick and fill them with soldiers and feel safe. A wall is the physical expression of the imperial mind: static, rigid, and terrified of what moves freely. Understand this and you understand how to defeat them.\n\nA wall protects what is behind it. It does not protect what is beside it, what is between walls, or what is beyond the wall\'s garrison range. The empire cannot build walls everywhere. Every wall they build is a commitment of stone, gold, and soldiers to one location. Every location they fortify is a location they cannot move from. They trade mobility for security and believe they have made a good bargain.\n\nThey have not.\n\nPRINCIPLE ONE: Never attack a wall. Go around it. There is always a gap. The empire\'s wall network has never been complete and never will be. They do not have enough stone, enough gold, or enough soldiers to wall off the entire northern border. Find the gaps. Exploit them. By the time the garrison responds, you should be twenty leagues away with everything you came for.\n\nPRINCIPLE TWO: Make the wall irrelevant. A castle protects a road, a bridge, a pass. If you do not need the road, the bridge, or the pass, the castle protects nothing. Our horses cross terrain that their supply wagons cannot. Ride where their castles are not.\n\nPRINCIPLE THREE: Make them come out. The garrison is safe inside. We cannot breach the walls without siege equipment we do not have and do not want. But the garrison has a duty to protect the surrounding territory. Burn the farms. Scatter the herds. Destroy the supplies. The garrison must either watch its purpose burn or ride out to stop you. When they ride out, they are on our ground. On open ground, our riders kill their infantry at three-to-one.\n\nPRINCIPLE FOUR: Walls cost more than raids. Every castle costs the empire thousands of gold and hundreds of soldiers to maintain. Every raid costs us nothing but time and risk. If we raid ten targets and they build walls around all ten, we have cost them ten fortunes. Then we raid ten different targets. The empire cannot afford to wall everything. We can afford to raid forever.\n\nPRINCIPLE FIVE: Walls create complacency. Soldiers who stand on walls forget how to fight in the field. Garrisons that have not been tested grow soft. When the next unification comes, the empire\'s wall soldiers will face riders who have fought every day of their lives. Stone will not save them.\n\nThe wall is the empire\'s answer to everything. It is the answer of people who are afraid. Remember this when you see their fortresses on the horizon. They built those walls because they fear you. Act accordingly.'

    content: 'INTEGRATION OF THE CONQUERED\nKhan\'s Archive -- Administrative Record, Great Khan Era\nTranscribed from oral tradition by the Elder of the Steppe\n\nResistance was punished. Submission was rewarded with protection. The humans call us savages. We absorbed more peoples peacefully than they have conquered by force.\n\nWhen the united clans rode south during the Great Khan\'s campaigns, they encountered dozens of peoples living under nominal imperial rule. Farmers, herders, miners, fishermen. Most had never seen an imperial soldier except when the tax collector came with an armed escort. They paid tribute to an empire that gave them nothing in return -- no protection from bandits, no arbitration of disputes, no maintenance of roads or bridges. They were imperial subjects in name and abandoned peoples in practice.\n\nThe Great Khan offered them a choice. The same choice he offered every settlement, every village, every town: submit to the authority of the clans and receive protection, or resist and be destroyed. This was not cruelty. It was clarity. The empire makes the same demand but wraps it in religious language and pretends it is a gift. The Khan was honest about what he was.\n\nThe majority submitted. Why would they not? The Khan\'s riders actually patrolled the roads. The Khan\'s arbiters actually settled disputes. The Khan\'s tax was lower than the empire\'s -- one-tenth of harvest and herds, compared to the empire\'s one-fifth plus church tithes plus emergency levies plus whatever the local lord decided to extract. Under orc administration, most conquered peoples were materially better off than they had been under the empire.\n\nThose who resisted were defeated. Their leaders were killed. Their soldiers were given the choice again: submit or die. Most submitted. The survivors were integrated into clan auxiliary forces, where they served alongside orc warriors and were treated according to their performance, not their origin. Many rose to positions of authority. The Great Khan\'s own quartermaster-general was a human who had fought against the clans in the first campaign and chosen submission over death.\n\nThe empire tells its citizens that orc conquest means massacre, slavery, and barbarism. The empire lies. The empire lies because the truth is more dangerous than any orc army: that the clans governed more justly, more efficiently, and more honestly than the Dominion has ever managed. The truth threatens the empire\'s claim to divine mandate. If orcs -- faithless, godless, uncivilized orcs -- can govern better than Helios\'s chosen people, what does that say about Helios\'s choice?\n\nThe unification period was not perfect. Resources were strained. Cultural misunderstandings caused friction. Some clan leaders abused their authority and were punished by the Khan when discovered. But the fundamental approach -- clear expectations, fair taxation, genuine protection, advancement by merit -- produced a multi-ethnic domain that functioned better than anything the empire has built.\n\nWhen the next unification comes, this record must guide the new Khan\'s administration. Conquest is easy. Governance is difficult. The Great Khan understood this. His successors did not, and that is why the clans fractured.\n\nLet the next Khan learn from both the success and the failure.'

Either way, hear this:\n\nWe were here first. Before the empire. Before their god. Before their roads and their castles and their legions. The hills were ours. The tunnels were ours. The mines were ours. We lived, we built, we raised our children, and we harmed no one who did not harm us.\n\nThey came with swords and fire and a god who told them everything they saw was theirs by divine right. They did not ask. They did not negotiate. They did not offer terms. They came and they killed and they took.\n\nWe fight because there is no alternative. Surrender means extermination. The empire does not take goblin prisoners. The empire does not relocate goblin populations. The empire clears warrens. You know what that means. Fire poured into tunnels. Smoke to drive families into the open. Soldiers waiting at every exit. Children cut down beside their parents.\n\nThis is not ancient history. This happened last year. This happened last month. This is happening RIGHT NOW in the eastern territories.\n\nWe fight because we are alive and we intend to stay alive. That is all the justification we need.

Animals do not have archivists who spend their lives memorizing the names of the dead so that no massacre is ever forgotten.\n\nWe do all of these things. We have done them since before the empire existed.\n\nThe Long Memory is our most sacred institution. In every warren, there is at least one Keeper -- a goblin trained from childhood in the art of perfect recall. The Keeper knows the names. Every name. Every warren that was destroyed. Every elder who was killed. Every child who did not survive. The Keeper knows the dates, the locations, the methods. Whether it was fire or smoke or blade. Whether there was warning or whether the soldiers came at dawn without announcement. Whether the bodies were left or burned or thrown into pits.\n\nThe empire has destroyed our written records many times. They burn our libraries when they find them. They believe that destroying our records destroys our memory. They do not understand that our true records are carried in living minds, passed from Keeper to Keeper in unbroken chains that stretch back to the first imperial incursion four centuries ago.\n\nFour centuries of massacre. Four centuries of names. The current count -- as of the last convocation of Keepers, eleven years ago -- is eight hundred and twelve warren destructions, with an estimated total death count of four hundred thousand goblins. These numbers are conservative. They include only confirmed events with surviving witnesses. The true numbers are higher.\n\nThe empire\'s own historians mention goblin casualties in passing, if at all. Their accounts speak of warrens cleared, territories pacified, infestations eliminated. They do not use names. They do not count the dead. To them, we are a problem to be solved, not a people to be mourned.\n\nThis is why the Long Memory matters. Because if we do not remember ourselves, no one will. The empire will erase us from history as it tries to erase us from the land. Every name the Keepers preserve is an act of defiance. Every massacre they memorize is evidence that the empire cannot destroy.\n\nThey ask why we resist. We recite the list. When we are finished -- three days later, our voices raw, our eyes burning -- we ask them: after hearing that, would YOU stop resisting?\n\nNo one has ever said yes.\n\nThe Long Memory continues.

The empire cannot maintain alert status for five years. You can maintain intent for five years. Use this.\n\nPRINCIPLE: Every soldier guarding a bridge is a soldier not on the front line.

Prioritize intelligence gathering over direct action. Know where they are. Know when they move. Know what they protect and what they neglect.\n\nPRINCIPLE: Never hold ground. Ground can be retaken.

Their histories are written by their scholars in their universities funded by their church. They decide what is taught. They decide what is remembered. They decide what is true. And what they have decided is true about goblins is a lie so comprehensive that even some of our own people have begun to believe it.\n\nLIE: Goblins are primitive and lack culture.\nTRUTH: Goblin oral traditions predate imperial written language by centuries. Our architectural techniques -- the interlocking tunnel systems that their engineers cannot replicate -- represent engineering knowledge accumulated over millennia. Our medicinal knowledge of underground fungi and minerals exceeds anything their apothecaries have achieved. We are not primitive. We are different. The empire cannot tell the distinction.\n\nLIE: Goblins raid because they are violent by nature.\nTRUTH: We raid because the empire occupies our agricultural land, our mining territories, and our trade routes. We raid because the alternative is starvation. Before the empire arrived, goblin communities were largely self-sufficient. We farmed underground. We traded with the dwarves. We mined and smelted and crafted. The empire destroyed our self-sufficiency and then blamed us for the desperation that followed.\n\nLIE: Goblins cannot be reasoned with.\nTRUTH: The empire has never tried. Not once in four centuries has the Dominion sent a diplomatic envoy to a goblin warren. Not once have they offered terms that did not amount to unconditional surrender and forced relocation. They have never tried to reason with us because reasoning requires acknowledging that we are people, and acknowledging that we are people would make their genocide much harder to justify.\n\nLIE: Goblin warrens are nests of filth and disease.\nTRUTH: Goblin warrens are engineered environments with ventilation systems, water management, waste processing, and temperature regulation. They are cleaner and better organized than the average imperial slum. The empire has never inspected a functioning warren. They have only seen the ruins they created.\n\nEvery lie serves the same purpose: to make imperial citizens comfortable with what their empire does to us. If we are vermin, extermination is pest control. If we are savages, conquest is civilization. If we are mindless, there is nothing to feel guilty about.\n\nWe are none of these things. We are people. We were here first. We want to live.\n\nCounter every lie. Correct every falsehood. The truth is our most dangerous weapon, because the empire\'s power depends on its citizens never hearing it.'

They are dying slowly instead of quickly, and they are taking the rest of us with them.\n\nEvery goblin who informs on a resistance cell costs lives.

Every goblin who accepts relocation validates the empire\'s claim that we do not belong on our own land. Collaboration is not survival. It is participation in our own destruction.\n\nWe understand the desperation. Starvation is real. Fear is real. The empire offers food to the hungry and safety to the frightened, and these are powerful offers. But the food comes with chains and the safety comes with silence, and both are temporary. The empire\'s history with subject peoples is clear: cooperation buys time, not survival.

The resistance does not execute those who return. We understand that desperation drove you to the empire\'s arms. Come back. Bring what you have learned about imperial operations. Your knowledge of their systems, their schedules, their weaknesses is more valuable than anything you gave them.\n\nTo those who continue to collaborate knowing full well what the empire does to our people: you have made your choice.

    content: 'THE EMPIRE CANNOT WIN\nStrategic assessment by the Cell Archive\nDistribute to all warrens. This is not hope. This is math.\n\nThey cannot eradicate us without depopulating entire regions. We have nothing left to lose. We have multi-generational commitment. We know every tunnel. The empire cannot win this war. Here is why.\n\nDEMOGRAPHICS: Imperial census data -- obtained through sources we will not identify -- estimates the goblin population of the eastern territories at approximately two hundred thousand. The empire has committed twelve thousand soldiers to eastern garrison duty. That is a ratio of one soldier for every seventeen goblins. Military doctrine holds that effective population control requires a ratio of one soldier for every five civilians. The empire would need to quadruple its eastern garrison to achieve basic control. It cannot afford this. The northern orc border absorbs sixty percent of imperial military capacity. The remaining forty percent is split between internal security, western patrols, and the eastern goblin territories. There are not enough soldiers.\n\nGEOGRAPHY: The eastern territories contain an estimated fourteen thousand kilometers of underground tunnel systems. The empire has mapped approximately eight hundred kilometers, or six percent. We know every tunnel. They are fighting blind in our home. Clearing a single warren requires an average of three hundred soldiers and two weeks of operations. At that rate, clearing all known warrens would take forty years of continuous operations, during which we would be building new warrens faster than they can clear old ones.\n\nECONOMICS: The Eastern Goblin Campaigns cost eight million gold for zero net result. The ongoing garrison network costs four million gold per year for a thirty percent reduction in goblin activity. The empire is spending more to suppress us than the eastern territories generate in revenue. We are not just winning the war of attrition. We are bankrupting them.\n\nCOMMITMENT: Imperial soldiers serve tours of duty. They rotate home. They retire. They have families and farms and lives to return to. We have nothing to return to. Our homes are the tunnels they are trying to destroy. Our families are the people they are trying to kill. Every goblin in the eastern territories is a combatant by circumstance if not by choice. We do not rotate. We do not retire. We do not go home because this IS home.\n\nGENERATIONAL PERSISTENCE: The resistance is four centuries old. The current generation of fighters was raised by fighters who were raised by fighters. Resistance is not a choice we make. It is the culture we were born into. The empire would need to kill every goblin to end the resistance, and killing every goblin would require resources the empire does not have and atrocities that even the Luminary Inquest cannot justify.\n\nThe empire cannot win. They know this. Their own policy analysts have said as much -- read the intercepted documents we have circulated. The question is not whether the empire will withdraw from the eastern territories. The question is how many more of us they will kill before they accept the inevitable.\n\nHold. Endure. Outlast. The math is on our side.'

The dwarves isolate. Stability requires none to gain decisive advantage. Our role is to ensure this.\n\nThis assessment represents the Council\'s annual review of inter-factional power dynamics in the Age After War, Year 847. As with all such assessments, it is intended for internal use only and reflects analytical conclusions, not policy positions.\n\nTHE HOLY DOMINION (HUMAN EMPIRE)\nStrength: Expanding. The Dominion\'s territory has grown by approximately three percent annually over the last decade, primarily through settlement of previously contested border regions. Military capacity remains the highest of any single faction, though spread increasingly thin across an expanding frontier. Economic output is strong but increasingly dependent on resource extraction from conquered territories.\nWeakness: Overextension. The Dominion is approaching the historical threshold at which empires begin to contract -- the point where the cost of maintaining borders exceeds the revenue generated by the territory within them. The eastern goblin territories are already net-negative. The northern border requires permanent garrison commitment. The Dominion\'s theocratic governance provides ideological cohesion but prevents adaptive policy-making.\nAssessment: The Dominion is the strongest single power but is weakening relative to its commitments. Trajectory suggests peak power within twenty to forty years, followed by gradual contraction.\n\nTHE ORC CLANS\nStrength: Individual clan military capability remains formidable. Iron Tusk and Stormborn alliance represents the most significant consolidation since the Great Khan. Warrior culture produces excellent individual combatants.\nWeakness: Fragmentation. Without unification, the clans cannot project power beyond raiding range. Inter-clan rivalries consume resources that could be directed outward. No economic base beyond pastoral herding and raiding.\nAssessment: Moderate and stable threat. The key variable is unification. If a new Khan emerges, threat assessment changes from moderate to existential within one generation.\n\nTHE GOBLIN RESISTANCE\nStrength: Asymmetric capability. The resistance operates at minimal cost while imposing maximum cost on the Dominion. Tunnel networks provide strategic depth that conventional forces cannot eliminate. Multi-generational commitment ensures continuity.\nWeakness: No capacity for conventional warfare. Cannot hold territory against determined imperial assault. Internal divisions between resistance factions reduce effectiveness.\nAssessment: The resistance will not defeat the empire. The empire will not defeat the resistance. This stalemate serves the balance of power and should be maintained.\n\nTHE GNOMISH COLLECTIVE\nStrength: Technological capability exceeds all other factions. Economic output per capita is the highest in the known world. Defensive automation makes invasion cost-prohibitive.\nWeakness: Small population. Geographic isolation. Secrecy limits diplomatic options.\nAssessment: The gnomes are the most significant unknown variable. If their technology is revealed, it will destabilize every existing power relationship.\n\nTHE DWARVEN HOLDS\nStrength: Economic self-sufficiency. Defensive terrain. Superior metallurgy and engineering.\nWeakness: Isolationist policy limits influence. Declining population. Dependent on trade for agricultural products.\nAssessment: Stable and declining. The dwarves are withdrawing from surface affairs and will continue to do so absent a direct threat to their holds.\n\nCOUNCIL RECOMMENDATION\nThe current balance, while imperfect, prevents any single faction from achieving dominance. Our priority must be monitoring the two most likely disruption scenarios: orc unification and gnomish exposure. Resources should be allocated accordingly.\n\nFiled with the Archive Division. Next assessment due Year 848.'

    content: 'THE PROBLEM OF FAITH-BASED GOVERNANCE\nArchive Division Assessment, Year 845\nRestricted -- Council members and senior analysts only\n\nWhen law derives from divine mandate, it cannot be questioned. When it cannot be questioned, it cannot be corrected. The empire\'s greatest strength is its greatest flaw.\n\nThe Holy Dominion derives its authority from the Helionic faith. The Emperor rules because Helios ordains it. The laws are just because they reflect divine will. The expansion is righteous because it spreads divine light. This is the foundation upon which the largest political entity in the known world is built, and it is fundamentally unstable.\n\nThe strength of theocratic governance is cohesion. Imperial citizens share a common cosmology, a common moral framework, and a common understanding of their place in the world. The church provides education, charity, dispute resolution, and community structure in every settlement from the capital to the frontier. This creates a unified society that secular governance struggles to match. Imperial citizens will endure hardship, sacrifice wealth, and march to war because they believe -- genuinely, deeply believe -- that they serve a divine purpose. This is enormously powerful.\n\nThe weakness of theocratic governance is rigidity. Divine law cannot be amended. If Helios has declared that all peoples must live under His light, then expansion is non-negotiable regardless of its practical consequences. If the Liturgy holds that hierarchy is the natural order, then alternative governance models cannot be explored regardless of their effectiveness. If the church teaches that non-human peoples are spiritually inferior, then equitable diplomacy is impossible regardless of its strategic value.\n\nWe have observed this pattern in every theocratic civilization we have studied over the centuries, and we have studied many. The initial phase is characterized by rapid expansion, strong social cohesion, and genuine prosperity. The faith provides purpose. Purpose drives achievement. Achievement validates faith. The cycle is self-reinforcing and powerful.\n\nThe second phase begins when the civilization encounters problems that faith cannot solve. Resource depletion. Climate shifts. Military overextension. Demographic changes. These are material problems requiring material solutions, but material solutions that contradict divine law are forbidden. The civilization cannot adapt because adaptation would require questioning the divine framework, and questioning the divine framework is heresy.\n\nThe third phase is decline. The problems accumulate. The solutions remain forbidden. The gap between doctrine and reality widens. Internal dissent grows. The church responds to dissent with intensified orthodoxy, which accelerates the cycle. Eventually, the civilization either reforms -- abandoning or radically reinterpreting its theocratic foundations -- or collapses.\n\nThe Holy Dominion is currently in the late first phase, approaching the second. Its expansion is generating material problems -- the goblin resistance, the orc border, resource depletion in older provinces -- that its theocratic framework cannot address effectively. The Luminary Inquest\'s response has been consistent with historical patterns: intensified orthodoxy, expanded military commitment, and suppression of internal criticism.\n\nThis does not mean the Dominion will collapse soon. Theocratic civilizations can persist in the second phase for centuries, particularly if they face no existential external threat. But the trajectory is set. The Dominion\'s faith gives it the power to expand but denies it the flexibility to manage what it has expanded into.\n\nOur policy should be to monitor the transition between phases and prepare for the instability that the third phase will produce. When the Dominion begins to fragment -- and it will fragment, given sufficient time -- the resulting power vacuum will be the most dangerous period since the fall of Calidar.\n\nWe must be ready.'

    content: 'ON THE REGULATION OF DESTRUCTIVE FORCE\nCouncil Analyst Theronil, Year 846\nPresented to the Full Council\n\nUnregulated power destroyed Calidar. The empire builds weapons of faith. The gnomes build weapons of function. Both must be monitored. Both must, if necessary, be constrained.\n\nThis document addresses what this analyst considers the single most important strategic concern facing the Council: the proliferation of destructive capability among civilizations that lack adequate systems of restraint.\n\nTHE CALIDAR PRECEDENT\nThe destruction of Calidar was not a natural disaster. It was a decision. A single decision, made by a single individual, wielding power that no single individual should possess. The details remain classified at the highest level, but the outcome is visible to anyone who looks south: a wasteland where a civilization once stood. Millions dead. An ecosystem destroyed. A wound in the world that has not healed and may never heal.\n\nCalidar was destroyed because its people developed the capacity to destroy it and did not develop the wisdom to prevent its use. This is the central lesson of our age, and it is a lesson that no other civilization appears to have learned.\n\nTHE HOLY DOMINION\nThe Dominion\'s destructive capacity is primarily military, but the Luminary Inquest has been developing faith-based applications that concern this analyst significantly. The Rites of Purification, deployed in the eastern goblin campaigns, are capable of rendering large areas uninhabitable. The Sanctified Ordnance program, details of which are scarce, appears to involve channeling divine energy into weapons of unprecedented destructive power.\n\nThe Dominion\'s restraint system is the Helionic faith itself, which prohibits the destruction of land that might be claimed for Helios. This restraint has held so far. But faith is not a reliable constraint on power, because faith can be reinterpreted to justify whatever the faithful wish to do. If the Inquest decides that a territory cannot be claimed and must instead be cleansed, the doctrinal prohibition becomes a doctrinal mandate.\n\nTHE GNOMISH COLLECTIVE\nThe gnomes\'s technological capability is advancing rapidly. Our intelligence -- limited, as gnomish security is excellent -- suggests that they have achieved energy manipulation capacities that rival or exceed pre-Calidar levels. Their automaton armies alone represent a military force multiplier that would allow their small population to contest any conventional military on the continent.\n\nThe gnomes\'s restraint system is their collective governance, which requires broad consensus for any significant action. This is more robust than the Dominion\'s faith-based restraint, but it is not immune to failure. A sufficiently existential threat -- discovery by the empire, for example -- could generate the consensus needed to deploy their full capability. We have modeled this scenario. The results are alarming.\n\nTHE COUNCIL\'S ROLE\nWe have maintained the balance of power for centuries. We have done so through diplomacy, through intelligence, through selective intervention, and through the quiet management of information flows between civilizations. This work must continue, but it must also expand to encompass the direct monitoring and, where possible, the limitation of destructive capability.\n\nWe cannot prevent civilizations from developing dangerous capacities. We can ensure that no civilization develops such capacity in secret, without the knowledge of others who might be threatened by it. Transparency -- forced, if necessary -- is our most effective tool.\n\nCalidar happened because no one was watching. We are watching now. We must never stop.\n\nRecommendation: Expand Intelligence Division operations targeting both Dominion military-faith programs and gnomish technological development. Priority: immediate.'

It demands worship. It demands obedience to divine authority. Everything the Collective is built on -- equality, collective ownership, rational governance, the rejection of gods and kings -- is heresy to the empire. They would not conquer us. They would convert us. And conversion, for us, is extinction.\n\nWe have studied the empire\'s integration of other peoples. The pattern is consistent. First, missionaries. Then, merchants. Then, administrators. Then, soldiers -- but only if the first three fail. The empire prefers to absorb cultures rather than destroy them, and absorption is more dangerous than destruction because it is harder to resist. A sword you can fight. A school that teaches your children that hierarchy is natural and gods are real is a weapon against which there is no defense except distance.\n\nOUR TECHNOLOGY WOULD BE WEAPONIZED\nThe surface powers would not use our technology as we use it. We build automatons to free citizens from dangerous labor. The empire would build automatons to replace soldiers. We develop energy systems to power workshops and homes. The empire would develop energy systems to power weapons. Every tool we have created for the benefit of our people would be repurposed for the subjugation of others.\n\nWe have a moral obligation to prevent this. Our technology exists to serve equality. Releasing it into a world defined by hierarchy, conquest, and exploitation would make us complicit in every atrocity it enables.\n\nTHE WORLD IS NOT READY\nThis is not arrogance. It is observation. The surface powers cannot govern themselves without resorting to violence, oppression, and the exploitation of the vulnerable. The empire conquers. The orcs raid. The goblins are exterminated. The dwarves withdraw. The elves manipulate. None of them have solved the basic problem of civilization: how to organize a society that does not require someone to suffer at the bottom.\n\nWe have solved it. Not perfectly -- no solution is perfect -- but sufficiently. No gnome starves. No gnome is homeless. No gnome labors without choice or compensation. No gnome is told that their voice matters less than another\'s. We achieved this through collective ownership, rational planning, and the absolute rejection of the idea that any person has a natural right to rule another.\n\nWe hide because revealing ourselves would destroy what we have built, either through imperial conquest or through the weaponization of our achievements. When the world is ready for what we have learned, we will share it. Until then, secrecy is not cowardice. It is responsibility.\n\nWelcome to the Collective. You are equal here. Guard that equality with your silence.'

    content: 'EXTERNAL THREAT ASSESSMENT, YEAR 499\nSecurity Bureau -- Classified\nDistribution: Production Council, Defense Committee, Archive Division\n\nHuman expansion continues. Probability of discovery within two centuries: 34%. Recommended response: accelerate automaton production. Maintain absolute information security. Prepare contingencies.\n\nThis assessment updates the Security Bureau\'s ongoing analysis of external threats to the Collective\'s security and secrecy.\n\nPRIMARY THREAT: IMPERIAL EXPANSION\nThe Holy Dominion\'s western maritime activity has increased 12% over the previous five-year period. Fishing fleets now operate within 200 nautical miles of the outer archipelago, compared to 340 nautical miles five years ago. Trading vessels have been observed surveying previously uncharted island chains in the mid-western sea. No imperial vessel has approached within 100 nautical miles of Collective territory, but the trend line is concerning.\n\nProbability models have been updated. Based on current expansion rates, maritime technology development, and imperial strategic priorities, the probability of accidental discovery of Collective territory within the next two centuries is estimated at 34%, up from 28% in the previous assessment. The probability of intentional discovery -- following intelligence about our existence -- is estimated at 11%, unchanged.\n\nSECONDARY THREAT: INFORMATION LEAKAGE\nThe Collective\'s existence is not entirely unknown. Elven intelligence services are aware of our general location and approximate capabilities, based on intercepted communications analyzed by the Bureau. Trade contacts with dwarven merchant houses have provided limited information about our material culture. Several gnomish exiles -- estimated at twelve over the past century -- have reached the continent and may have shared information about Collective society.\n\nRisk assessment: The elves have no incentive to reveal our existence, as our isolation serves their balance-of-power strategy. The dwarves are commercially motivated and will protect a profitable trade relationship. The exiles represent the highest risk, though debriefing analysis suggests that most possessed limited knowledge of critical technologies.\n\nTERTIARY THREAT: INTERNAL DISSENT\nA small but persistent minority within the Collective advocates for open contact with surface civilizations. Their arguments center on moral obligations to share technological advances that could alleviate suffering. The Bureau assesses this movement as philosophically sincere but strategically naive. Current support is estimated at 6% of the population, insufficient to influence Council policy but sufficient to warrant monitoring.\n\nDEFENSE READINESS\nCurrent automaton deployment: 8,400 units across seven islands. Projected requirement for defense against a full imperial naval assault: 12,000 units. Production capacity at current rates will achieve this threshold within fifteen years. The Bureau recommends accelerating production to achieve the threshold within eight years.\n\nAdditionally, the Bureau recommends:\n- Expansion of the outer monitoring network to provide 72-hour advance warning of approaching vessels\n- Development of non-lethal deterrent systems to redirect vessels without revealing Collective presence\n- Updated contingency planning for the scenario of confirmed discovery, including diplomatic protocols and, if necessary, demonstration of defensive capability sufficient to deter invasion without revealing full technological capacity\n\nSUMMARY\nThe Collective\'s security posture remains strong but faces a slowly deteriorating external environment. Imperial expansion is the primary driver. The Bureau\'s assessment is that current policies are adequate for the near term but will require adjustment within fifty years.\n\nThe Collective has survived through secrecy. Secrecy is a finite resource. We must prepare for its eventual exhaustion.\n\nBureau Director\'s seal. Classification: Maximum. Unauthorized distribution is a collective security offense.'

    content: 'THE FAILURE OF INDIVIDUAL OWNERSHIP\nEconomic Analysis Division -- Educational Series, Volume 7\nFor use in citizenship education programs\n\nThe empire\'s citizens starve beside full granaries. Their poor freeze beside empty homes. Ownership creates artificial scarcity. We have eliminated this inefficiency.\n\nThis volume examines the economic systems of the surface civilizations, with particular focus on the Holy Dominion, and explains why the Collective rejected individual ownership as the foundation of its economy.\n\nTHE IMPERIAL MODEL\nThe Dominion operates on a system of private property mediated by markets. Individuals own land, tools, resources, and the products of labor. They trade these goods through markets where prices are determined by supply and demand. The church and the state extract a portion of economic activity through tithes and taxes. This system is presented by imperial economists as natural, efficient, and divinely ordained.\n\nIt is none of these things.\n\nThe imperial economy produces enormous aggregate wealth. It distributes that wealth with staggering inefficiency. Current intelligence estimates suggest that the wealthiest five percent of imperial citizens control approximately sixty percent of all productive land and capital. The bottom forty percent of imperial citizens own effectively nothing -- they labor on land they do not own, with tools they do not own, producing goods that belong to someone else, in exchange for wages that cover basic survival and little more.\n\nThe result is predictable. Imperial cities contain neighborhoods of extraordinary luxury adjacent to neighborhoods of extraordinary squalor. Granaries overflow while families go hungry -- not because there is insufficient food, but because the hungry cannot afford to buy it. Homes stand empty while families sleep in the streets -- not because there is insufficient housing, but because the homeless cannot afford the rent. The imperial economy does not have a production problem. It has a distribution problem. Ownership creates artificial scarcity by restricting access to abundant resources based on ability to pay rather than need.\n\nTHE COLLECTIVE MODEL\nThe Collective operates on a system of collective ownership mediated by planning. All productive resources -- land, workshops, tools, raw materials -- are owned collectively and managed by the Production Council on behalf of all citizens. Production targets are set based on assessed need, not market demand. Distribution is based on need, not ability to pay.\n\nEvery citizen receives: housing appropriate to their household size, food sufficient for health, clothing, medical care, education, and access to cultural and recreational facilities. These are not charity. They are not earned. They are the baseline conditions of citizenship, provided because they are necessary for a dignified life and the Collective possesses the resources to provide them.\n\nCitizens who wish to contribute beyond the baseline -- and most do, because meaningful work is a human need, not merely an economic obligation -- receive access to additional resources, specialized equipment, advanced education, and project funding through the Council\'s allocation process.\n\nTHE RESULTS\nThe Collective\'s per-capita output exceeds the empire\'s by a factor of approximately three. Our infant mortality rate is one-fifth of theirs. Our literacy rate is universal. Our average lifespan exceeds theirs by twelve years. We have no beggars, no debtors, no debtors\' prisons, no poorhouses, and no charity -- because charity is only necessary in systems that produce poverty, and we have eliminated poverty by eliminating the mechanism that creates it.\n\nImperial economists would argue that our system stifles innovation and individual initiative. Our automaton technology, our energy systems, our medical advances, and our agricultural yields suggest otherwise. When citizens are freed from the fear of destitution, they do not become lazy. They become creative. They pursue excellence because they want to, not because starvation is the alternative.\n\nIndividual ownership is not natural. It is a choice, and it is a bad one. The Collective made a better choice. The evidence speaks for itself.'

    content: 'SURFACE POLITICS: WHY WE DO NOT ENGAGE\nGuild Council Archive -- Position Statement\nReaffirmed by unanimous vote, Year 844\n\nThey fight over crowns. They kill for thrones. They worship gods who demand obedience. We build. Let them exhaust themselves.\n\nThe Guild Council is periodically asked -- by young dwarves, by trade envoys, by the occasional elven diplomat -- why the holds do not participate in surface politics. Why we do not ally with the empire, or the orc clans, or anyone else. Why we sit in our mountains while the world above burns with one conflict after another.\n\nThe answer is simple: surface politics is a waste of time, resources, and lives, and we refuse to waste any of the three.\n\nConsider the history. In the last three centuries, the surface civilizations have fought fourteen major wars and uncounted minor ones. Borders have shifted back and forth across the same territories dozens of times. Cities have been built, destroyed, rebuilt, and destroyed again. Millions have died. And what has changed? Nothing of substance. The empire still expands. The orcs still raid. The goblins still resist. The elves still scheme. The same conflicts, the same patterns, the same pointless cycle of violence and rebuilding and violence again.\n\nIn those same three centuries, the holds have expanded our tunnel networks by four hundred kilometers. We have developed three new alloy compositions. We have improved our extraction efficiency by thirty percent. We have built works of beauty and permanence that will stand for millennia. We have done this because we do not waste our time killing each other over which piece of dirt belongs to which king.\n\nThe surface peoples are obsessed with control -- control of land, control of people, control of trade routes and resources and the gods themselves. They cannot conceive of a society that simply does not care about controlling others. When we tell them that we want only to be left alone to build and mine and craft, they do not believe us. They assume we are hiding our true ambitions. We are not. Our ambition is to build things that last. Their ambition is to build things that conquer. These are not compatible worldviews, and no alliance between us would survive the incompatibility.\n\nWe trade with everyone because trade is practical. We ally with no one because alliances are political, and politics is the surface disease we have successfully avoided for a thousand years. Let the humans worship their sun. Let the orcs ride their steppes. Let the goblins fight their tunnels. Let the elves pull their strings. We will be in our mountains, building.\n\nWhen they are all done exhausting themselves, we will still be here. We always are.\n\nThis position has served the holds well. The Council sees no reason to change it. Reaffirmed unanimously.'

    content: 'TRADE RELATIONS ASSESSMENT\nTrade Council Record, Year 846\nAnnual review for Guild Council and licensed merchants\n\nHumans: reliable customers, unstable politics. Elves: precise negotiations, slow payment. Orcs: honor agreements, unpredictable availability. Goblins: excellent barter partners when accessible. Gnomes: small volume, exceptional quality exchange.\n\nThis record summarizes the Trade Council\'s assessment of current commercial relationships with surface and external partners. As always, trade policy is strictly non-political. We sell to everyone who pays. We buy from everyone who delivers. Preferences are based on reliability and value, not ideology.\n\nHOLY DOMINION (HUMANS)\nVolume: High. The empire is our largest trade partner by volume. Primary exports: refined metals, alloys, precision tools, architectural stone. Primary imports: grain, textiles, timber, livestock.\nAssessment: The empire\'s appetite for dwarven metalwork is effectively unlimited. Their own smelting and forging capabilities are adequate for common applications but cannot match our quality for military, architectural, or precision work. Payment is reliable when dealing with established merchant houses. Imperial government contracts pay well but are subject to political disruption -- a change in provincial governor can void contracts without notice. Recommendation: continue high-volume trade, prefer private merchant partners over government contracts.\nRisk: The empire periodically attempts to negotiate exclusive trade agreements that would prevent us from selling to other parties. These are always refused. The empire occasionally threatens to embargo dwarven goods in retaliation. These threats have never been carried out because the empire needs our metals more than we need their grain.\n\nELVEN TERRITORIES\nVolume: Moderate. Primary exports: gemstones, decorative metalwork, rare mineral specimens. Primary imports: preserved foods, textiles, herbal medicines, intelligence reports.\nAssessment: The elves are excellent negotiators and demand exceptional quality. Transactions are profitable but slow -- elven approval processes for major purchases can take months. Payment is always in full but often delayed. The elves also trade in information, which has proven valuable for monitoring surface political developments that might affect trade routes.\nRisk: Minimal. The elves have no interest in disrupting a profitable relationship.\n\nORC CLANS\nVolume: Low to moderate, highly variable. Primary exports: weapons, armor, horse equipment. Primary imports: hides, bone, rare herbs, horses.\nAssessment: Individual orc traders are among the most straightforward partners we deal with. Agreements are verbal, honored without exception, and completed efficiently. The difficulty is availability -- orc trade caravans are irregular, dependent on clan movements and inter-clan politics. A reliable trading partner may disappear for years if their clan migrates or goes to war.\nRisk: Low direct risk. The orcs have never threatened or raided a dwarven trade caravan. They view us as neutral and useful, which is exactly the relationship we prefer.\n\nGOBLIN COMMUNITIES\nVolume: Low. Primary exports: metal tools, lighting equipment. Primary imports: rare fungi, underground minerals, tunnel survey data.\nAssessment: Goblin traders are resourceful, inventive, and operate under enormous constraints due to imperial persecution. Trade is conducted through hidden markets in border regions, which limits volume. The goblins offer unique goods -- particularly fungal compounds with medicinal and industrial applications -- that are unavailable from any other source. Barter is preferred over currency.\nRisk: Association with goblin traders carries political risk if discovered by the empire. The Trade Council considers this risk acceptable given the unique value of goblin goods.\n\nGNOMISH COLLECTIVE\nVolume: Very low. Primary exports: precision components, specialized alloys. Primary imports: automaton parts, optical instruments, technical manuals.\nAssessment: The gnomes are the only trading partner whose craftsmanship rivals our own. Exchange is conducted through intermediaries and is limited by gnomish security requirements. The quality of gnomish goods is extraordinary. The Trade Council would welcome expanded trade but respects gnomish limitations.\nRisk: Near zero. The gnomes are more concerned about secrecy than we are.\n\nSUMMARY: Trade relationships remain stable and profitable. No changes to policy recommended. Continue selling to everyone. Continue buying from everyone. Let the surface sort out its own problems.'

    content: 'SECT REPORT: IMPERIAL EXPANSION PATTERNS\nIntelligence Sect -- Pattern Analysis Division\nYear 847, Third Cycle\n\nThe empire moves predictably. Faith justifies conquest. Conquest enables extraction. Extraction funds faith. The cycle continues until resources exhaust. This report documents the pattern and its implications for sect operations.\n\nThe Intelligence Sect has maintained continuous observation of the Holy Dominion for three hundred and twelve years. In that time, we have documented seven major expansion phases and twenty-three minor territorial acquisitions. The pattern is consistent, predictable, and -- critically -- self-limiting.\n\nPHASE ONE: THEOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION\nEvery expansion begins with the Luminary Inquest issuing a doctrinal statement identifying a territory as "in darkness" and therefore requiring imperial intervention. The language varies -- sometimes it emphasizes saving human populations from non-imperial governance, sometimes it emphasizes the spiritual peril of non-human populations, sometimes it simply declares that Helios\'s light must reach further. The content is irrelevant. The function is always the same: to provide moral authority for military action.\n\nPHASE TWO: MILITARY OPERATION\nImperial legions advance into the designated territory. Resistance is overcome through a combination of direct military force and faith-based operations (Prelate-led rituals that boost morale, heal the wounded, and occasionally produce battlefield effects that our observers have been unable to fully explain). The military phase typically lasts one to five years depending on the strength of local resistance.\n\nPHASE THREE: ADMINISTRATIVE INTEGRATION\nImperial administrators establish governance structures. The church establishes temples and schools. Local populations are converted, relocated, or suppressed. Resource extraction operations begin -- mining, farming, logging, depending on the territory\'s assets. Tax collection commences. The integration phase typically lasts ten to twenty years.\n\nPHASE FOUR: EXTRACTION\nThe territory is fully integrated into the imperial economy. Resources flow toward the core provinces. Tax revenue funds the church, the military, and the administrative apparatus. The local population provides labor. This phase is indefinite -- it continues until the territory\'s resources are depleted or the cost of maintaining imperial control exceeds the revenue generated.\n\nPHASE FIVE: DECLINE\nResource depletion, local resistance, or administrative neglect reduces the territory\'s value below the cost of maintenance. The empire faces a choice: invest in the territory (expensive, with diminishing returns) or withdraw (ideologically impossible, as abandoning claimed territory contradicts the doctrine of expansion). The result is invariably a compromise: reduced garrison, reduced investment, increased local autonomy in practice but not in principle. The territory becomes a net drain on imperial resources.\n\nThe eastern goblin territories are currently in Phase Five. The northern border provinces are in Phase Four. The central provinces are in late Phase Four, approaching Phase Five. The most recently acquired western territories are in Phase Three.\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR SECT OPERATIONS\nThe empire\'s expansion is self-limiting. Every new territory eventually becomes a burden rather than an asset. The empire cannot acknowledge this without undermining its theological foundation, so it continues to expand while its existing territories decay. This is a slow process -- centuries, not decades -- but it is irreversible absent fundamental reform of the Helionic governance model.\n\nThe Intelligence Sect recommends continued observation without intervention. The empire is not currently a threat to sect interests or to global stability. It is, however, approaching a critical mass of overextension that will eventually produce internal instability. The Intervention Sect should prepare contingency plans for that eventuality.\n\nThe cycle turns. We watch. We wait. We prepare.'

    content: 'ON THE NECESSITY OF INTERVENTION\nIntervention Sect Analysis -- Doctrinal Statement\nRevised and reaffirmed, Year 846\n\nWe do not seek conflict. We seek prevention. A single decision, made by a single person, destroyed Calidar. The sects exist to ensure such decisions are never made again.\n\nThe Intervention Sect operates under a mandate that predates every current surface civilization. That mandate is simple: prevent the concentration of destructive power sufficient to threaten the continuity of life on this continent. We do not govern. We do not conquer. We do not seek influence for its own sake. We intervene when intervention is necessary to prevent catastrophe, and only then.\n\nTHE CALIDAR MANDATE\nCalidarian civilization achieved a level of power that no subsequent civilization has matched. Their mastery of forces that surface peoples now call magic, divine energy, or natural philosophy was comprehensive and, ultimately, ungovernable. The entity known as Heaven\'s Atlas -- whether it was a weapon, a ritual, a being, or something our categories cannot capture -- was deployed by a single faction within Calidarian governance, without the knowledge or consent of the broader population. The result was annihilation.\n\nOur predecessors witnessed the destruction. They survived because they were observers, positioned at the margins, as we are positioned now. They made a decision: never again. They organized the sects. They established the monitoring networks. They committed our people -- for all generations to come -- to a single purpose: ensuring that no civilization, no faction, no individual ever again accumulates the power to destroy on a continental scale.\n\nHOW WE INTERVENE\nIntervention is graduated and proportional. We do not begin with violence. We begin with observation.\n\nLevel One: Monitoring. The Intelligence Sect observes. When a civilization begins developing capabilities that approach dangerous thresholds, the Intelligence Sect flags the development for review.\n\nLevel Two: Influence. The Intervention Sect deploys agents to subtly redirect dangerous research, policy, or military development. This may involve introducing competing priorities, creating bureaucratic obstacles, supporting internal opposition, or simply removing key documents from archives. Most interventions end at this level. The target civilization never knows we were involved.\n\nLevel Three: Disruption. When subtle influence fails, the Intervention Sect takes direct action to disable dangerous capabilities. This may involve sabotage of facilities, assassination of key individuals, or destruction of critical resources. Level Three interventions are rare -- fewer than twenty in three centuries -- and are authorized only by unanimous vote of the combined sect leadership.\n\nLevel Four: Open action. We have never conducted a Level Four intervention. It would involve the mobilization of our full capabilities against a target civilization. The sects maintain this option as a deterrent and a last resort. We hope it is never needed.\n\nCURRENT THREAT ASSESSMENT\nTwo developments require ongoing monitoring. First: the Holy Dominion\'s Luminary Inquest is developing faith-based weapons systems that, if scaled sufficiently, could approach Calidarian-level destructive capacity. Current assessment: decades from threshold, but trajectory is concerning. Second: the Gnomish Collective\'s technological development continues to accelerate. Their energy manipulation capabilities are the most advanced we have observed since Calidar. Current assessment: potentially at threshold, but constrained by collective governance and defensive orientation.\n\nNeither development currently warrants Level Three intervention. Both warrant expanded Level One and Level Two operations.\n\nWe are the memory of Calidar. We are the consequence of unchecked power. We watch because someone must. We intervene because the alternative is unthinkable.\n\nThe mandate continues. The sects endure. Calidar will not happen again.'

    content: 'THE THIRD ORC WAR: AN IMPERIAL ACCOUNT\nImperial Archive -- Official History, Year 841\nApproved by the Luminary Inquest for general distribution\n\nVictory was achieved through Helios\'s blessing and the sacrifice of seventeen legions. The border holds. For now.\n\nThe Third Orc War began in the spring of Year 835, when a coalition of northern orc clans -- principally the Iron Tusk, the Stormborn, and the Red Banner -- launched a coordinated assault on the imperial border provinces. The scale of the attack was unprecedented in living memory. Intelligence estimates placed the combined orc force at approximately forty thousand mounted warriors, supported by an unknown number of irregular fighters and camp followers.\n\nThe initial imperial response was catastrophic. The northern garrison network, designed to repel raids by individual clans, was overwhelmed within the first week. Fort Ashmark fell on the third day. Fort Greypeak fell on the fifth. The garrison at Thornwall held for nine days before being encircled and destroyed. The commanding officers of all three fortifications were killed. Approximately eight thousand imperial soldiers died in the first two weeks of the war.\n\nGeneral Aldric Voss, commanding the Second Imperial Army, organized a defensive line along the River Ash and prepared to hold until reinforcements arrived from the southern provinces. The river crossing at Ashford Bridge became the focal point of the campaign. Orc cavalry attempted to force the crossing seven times over three days. Each attempt was repelled, but at enormous cost -- the Second Army lost a third of its strength holding the bridge.\n\nReinforcements arrived in the fourth week. The combined Third and Fifth Imperial Armies, supplemented by Prelate-supported auxiliary units, brought total imperial strength to approximately fifty thousand troops. General Voss launched a counter-offensive aimed at recapturing the fallen border forts and pushing the orc coalition back beyond the Ashmark.\n\nThe counter-offensive achieved mixed results. Fort Greypeak was recaptured after a two-week siege in which the orcs, unaccustomed to defensive warfare, were unable to hold the fortification against sustained imperial assault. Fort Ashmark was recaptured without significant resistance -- the orcs had already withdrawn, taking everything of value. Thornwall was found destroyed beyond repair.\n\nThe decisive engagement of the war occurred at the Battle of Red Grass, where General Voss\'s combined force met the main orc army on open ground. The battle lasted two days. Imperial infantry formations held against repeated cavalry charges, but at terrible cost. The Prelate units -- channeling Helios\'s blessing in ways that this historian is not authorized to describe in detail -- proved decisive, breaking the orc center on the second day and forcing a general withdrawal.\n\nThe orc coalition retreated beyond the original border. Imperial forces pursued but were unable to force a second engagement -- the orc cavalry simply outran the pursuing infantry. A new garrison line was established along the Ashmark, reinforced to twice pre-war strength.\n\nCOST ASSESSMENT\nSeventeen legions engaged. Combined casualties: approximately twenty-two thousand killed, eight thousand wounded. Six border fortifications destroyed or severely damaged. Direct military expenditure: approximately thirty million gold. Economic disruption to the northern provinces: estimated at fifty million gold over the five-year recovery period.\n\nOUTCOME\nThe border holds at its pre-war position. No territory was permanently lost. The orc coalition has fragmented -- the Iron Tusk and Red Banner clans have reportedly fallen into dispute over the distribution of captured supplies. Intelligence suggests that the coalition is unlikely to reform in the near term.\n\nHelios blessed our arms and granted victory. The sacrifice of our soldiers will be honored in the Liturgy of Remembrance. The empire endures.\n\nBut let no reader mistake the cost for the conclusion. Twenty-two thousand dead to hold a line we already held. The orcs withdrew of their own accord, with their army intact. They will return. The only question is when.'

    content: 'THE THIRD HUMAN WAR: A CLAN ACCOUNT\nKhan\'s Archive -- Oral History Transcription\nRecorded from the testimony of War-Captain Brokk Stormborn, Year 838\n\nThey call it victory. We call it stalemate. Their legions broke against our riders. They retreated behind walls and called it winning. Let me tell you what actually happened.\n\nIn the spring of 835, the three great clans -- Iron Tusk, Stormborn, my own people, and the Red Banner -- rode south together for the first time since the Great Khan\'s era. Forty thousand riders. Not since the unification had the steppe put so many in the saddle at once. The old rivalries were set aside because the empire had pushed too far north, building forts on grazing land that had been ours since before their god had a name.\n\nWe hit them at dawn. Their border forts were a joke. Built to stop raids of a few hundred riders. We brought forty thousand. Fort Ashmark fell before the garrison commander had finished his breakfast. Greypeak lasted two days because the commander had the sense to barricade the gates and wait for us to get bored. Thornwall fought hard -- credit to their soldiers there, they died well. But they died.\n\nThe empire panicked. We could see it in how they moved -- pulling troops back, abandoning outer positions, concentrating behind the river. Their general -- Voss, a competent enough human -- made the right choice: hold the river crossing and wait for reinforcements. We tested the bridge seven times. Could have taken it on the fourth attempt if the Stormborn and Iron Tusk had coordinated better, but the war-chiefs were arguing about who would cross first. The old rivalries, even in the middle of a campaign.\n\nWhen their reinforcements arrived, we had a choice. The elders counseled withdrawal -- we had captured enormous quantities of weapons, tools, grain, and livestock from the border forts. The campaign was already a success by any material measure. But the war-chiefs wanted blood. They wanted to break the imperial army in the field and send a message that would echo for a generation.\n\nRed Grass was the result. Two days of fighting on the plain south of the Ashmark. Our riders against their infantry. In any fair fight -- any REAL fight -- our cavalry would have shattered their formations within hours. But the imperials had their priests. I do not understand what the priests do. I have seen it -- light that burns, shields that appear from nothing, wounds that close before the blood has time to flow. It is not natural. It is not honest. And at Red Grass, it was the difference.\n\nOur center broke on the second day. Not because the imperial soldiers outfought us -- man to man, our warriors killed three of theirs for every one of ours who fell. The center broke because the priests did something that killed two hundred riders in a single moment. A flash of light, and two hundred warriors -- good warriors, warriors I had trained -- were simply gone. The riders around them saw and wavered, and when cavalry wavers, it breaks.\n\nWe withdrew. Not routed -- the empire could not pursue us; their infantry cannot chase mounted warriors, and they knew better than to try. We rode north with our captured supplies, our surviving warriors, and the knowledge that we had gone toe to toe with the empire\'s full military strength and walked away intact.\n\nThe empire calls this their victory. Their victory cost them twenty-two thousand dead, six destroyed forts, and eighty million gold. Our cost was perhaps five thousand warriors -- painful, but sustainable. We returned to the steppe richer than we left. They returned to their borders poorer, weaker, and more frightened than before.\n\nIf that is victory, I would hate to see their defeats.\n\nThe coalition fragmented after the campaign -- the Iron Tusk and Red Banner fell to arguing about supply division, as they always do. But the lesson of the Third Human War is clear: when the clans ride together, the empire cannot stop us. It can only survive us. And survival is not victory, no matter how many hymns they sing about it.\n\nNext time, we will finish what we started.'

    content: 'CAMPAIGNS AGAINST THE GOBLIN INFESTATION\nImperial Archive -- Military Operations Summary\nEastern Territories Command, Years 831-834\n\nForty-seven warrens cleared in the eastern territories. Cost: 12,000 soldiers, 8 million gold. Result: Forty-seven new warrens appeared within the year. This report documents the campaigns and their outcomes.\n\nThe Eastern Goblin Campaigns were authorized by the Luminary Inquest in Year 831 following a sharp increase in goblin raiding activity across the eastern provinces. Provincial governors reported significant disruption to mining operations, agricultural output, and trade route security. The Inquest determined that a comprehensive military response was required to pacify the region.\n\nCampaign Commander General Haric Dunwell was given command of four legions -- approximately sixteen thousand soldiers -- with orders to systematically locate and clear all goblin warrens within the eastern territory. The campaign was expected to last one year. It lasted three.\n\nOPERATIONAL CHALLENGES\nThe primary challenge was locating the warrens. Goblin tunnel networks are extensive, well-concealed, and interconnected in ways that surface mapping cannot capture. A warren entrance might be a hole beneath a boulder, a crack in a cliff face, or a passage through an abandoned mine that appears to lead nowhere. Intelligence was unreliable -- local informants provided contradictory information, and captured goblins refused to reveal warren locations under any form of interrogation.\n\nThe secondary challenge was the clearing operations themselves. Warren tunnels are narrow, dark, and built to goblin proportions -- a human soldier in full armor can barely move through them. Conventional military formations are useless. Each clearing operation devolved into squad-level engagements in total darkness against defenders who knew every passage, every choke point, and every trap placement. Casualty rates for clearing squads averaged thirty percent per operation.\n\nThe tertiary challenge was collateral damage. Many warrens were located beneath or adjacent to productive land -- farms, mines, quarries. Clearing operations that used fire or smoke to flush goblins from tunnels frequently damaged the very infrastructure the campaign was intended to protect. Several mining operations were permanently disrupted by tunnel collapses caused by military action.\n\nRESULTS: YEAR ONE\nSeventeen warrens located and cleared. Military casualties: 3,200. Goblin casualties: estimated 8,000-12,000 (precise counts impossible due to tunnel conditions). Raiding activity in cleared areas decreased by approximately sixty percent.\n\nRESULTS: YEAR TWO\nFifteen additional warrens located and cleared. Military casualties: 4,100 (increased due to more sophisticated goblin defenses, including flooding traps and tunnel collapse mechanisms). New warrens detected in areas previously cleared. Raiding activity returned to pre-campaign levels in year-one cleared areas.\n\nRESULTS: YEAR THREE\nFifteen additional warrens cleared. Military casualties: 4,700. At campaign\'s end, reconnaissance indicated forty-seven new or re-established warrens in the eastern territories -- equal to the number cleared. Goblin population estimates showed no significant decrease.\n\nASSESSMENT\nThe Eastern Goblin Campaigns achieved temporary suppression of raiding activity in specific areas at extreme cost. Long-term results were negligible. The goblin population\'s ability to relocate, rebuild, and replenish losses exceeded the military\'s ability to project force into underground environments.\n\nGeneral Dunwell\'s after-action report, filed in Year 834, concluded with a recommendation that future anti-goblin operations focus on garrison containment rather than warren clearance. The general noted, with uncharacteristic candor for an official military document, that "we are attempting to drain the ocean with a bucket."\n\nThe Luminary Inquest has not approved a campaign of similar scale since. The eastern territories remain contested.'

We had warnings -- the sentries saw the torches on the ridge the night before -- but where do you go? The tunnels connect to other warrens, yes, but those warrens were being hit too. They were hitting everything at once. That was the plan. Hit everything so there was nowhere to run.\n\n"They poured something into the upper ventilation shafts. Oil, I think. Then they lit it. The fire came down through the vents like a living thing. The upper chambers went first -- the nurseries were in the upper chambers, because the air is better there for the little ones. We heard the screaming. We all heard the screaming.\n\n"Those of us in the lower chambers ran for the deep exits. The soldiers were waiting at most of them. I saw my husband cut down at the south exit. He was carrying our youngest. They killed them both. I got out through a drainage tunnel that the soldiers had not found. Thirty of us got out. Deephollow had four hundred people."\n\nTESTIMONY OF SKRIT, FORMERLY OF IRONVEIN WARREN\n"They called us out first. A human officer stood at the main entrance with a speaking horn and told us to surrender. He said we would be relocated. He said no one would be harmed. Twelve goblins went out. They were put in chains and marched away. We later learned they were taken to labor camps in the western mines. None survived the first year.\n\n"After the twelve went out, the soldiers came in. They had torches and short swords -- the kind made for tunnel fighting. They worked through the warren chamber by chamber. Methodical. No rage, no shouting. Just soldiers doing their job. They killed everyone they found. I hid in a waste shaft for two days. When I came out, the warren was empty. Blood on every wall. They had taken anything of value -- tools, food stores, ore samples. They left the bodies."\n\nTESTIMONY OF MIRA, FORMERLY OF GREENROOT WARREN\n"Greenroot was a farming warren. We grew mushrooms. We traded with the dwarves. We had not raided anyone in living memory. It did not matter. The soldiers came because we were goblins in imperial territory, and that was enough.\n\n"They used smoke. Wet wood in the ventilation shafts. The smoke filled the tunnels within an hour. You could not see. You could not breathe. People stumbled into walls, into each other. The elderly and the young died first -- their lungs could not take it.\n\n"I carried my daughter through the smoke. I could not see where I was going. I followed the wall with one hand and held her with the other. She was coughing. Then she stopped coughing. I kept walking. When I reached the outside, she was dead. She was four years old. She had never seen a human soldier before that day."\n\nTESTIMONY OF RATCH, WARREN UNKNOWN\n"I will not say which warren I am from. It still exists. I will say this: the empire\'s soldiers are not monsters. They are worse than monsters. Monsters act on instinct. These soldiers acted on orders. They killed children because someone in a distant city signed a document. They burned warrens because a council voted. The horror is not the violence. The horror is the bureaucracy. Our genocide was a line item in someone\'s budget."\n\nCELL ARCHIVE NOTE\nThese testimonies represent a fraction of the accounts collected. The full archive contains over three hundred individual statements from survivors of the Eastern Cleansing. They are preserved in multiple locations to prevent imperial destruction.\n\nThe empire\'s official history calls this campaign a success.

    content: 'THE UNIFICATION WAR: ARCHIVAL ANALYSIS\nArchive Division Assessment\nCompiled from intelligence reports spanning Years 502-534\n\nUnder the Great Khan, the orc clans conquered more territory in three decades than the empire has in three centuries. This analysis examines how, why, and what it means for the current balance of power.\n\nBACKGROUND\nThe entity known as the Great Khan -- birth name unrecorded in our archives, as orc naming conventions for leaders involve titles that supersede personal identity -- emerged from the Iron Tusk clan approximately Year 502. Within five years, he had unified the Iron Tusk with four neighboring clans through a combination of single combat challenges, strategic marriages, and what our observers described as extraordinary personal charisma. By Year 510, eighteen of the approximately forty steppe clans had pledged allegiance. By Year 515, all forty had been incorporated into what the orcs called the Great Horde.\n\nThe unification itself is remarkable. Orc clan rivalries are deep, personal, and often generational. Previous attempts at multi-clan alliance had collapsed within years. The Great Khan maintained unity for over three decades. Our analysts have identified several factors that distinguished his approach.\n\nFirst: the Khan did not demand submission. He demanded participation. Defeated warlords retained their positions as clan leaders. Their people retained their customs, their grazing territories, their internal governance. The Khan claimed authority only over inter-clan relations and external military operations. This was psychologically brilliant -- the warlords lost nothing except the ability to attack each other, and gained protection from everyone else.\n\nSecond: the Khan created shared prosperity. Trade routes between clans were secured. Disputes over water and grazing were arbitrated rather than fought. Resources were distributed according to need during harsh seasons. For the first time, being part of a larger orc political entity provided tangible material benefits to ordinary clan members.\n\nThird: the Khan provided a common enemy. Imperial expansion into the northern grasslands had been ongoing for decades. Individual clans had resisted piecemeal and failed. The Khan channeled the clans\' martial energy away from each other and toward the empire, transforming internal competition into external purpose.\n\nTHE CAMPAIGNS\nThe Great Khan\'s military campaigns against the Holy Dominion began in Year 517 and continued, with intermittent pauses, until Year 534. The scale was extraordinary. At peak strength, the Great Horde could field approximately eighty thousand mounted warriors -- a force larger than any army the Dominion had assembled before or has assembled since.\n\nThe campaigns were characterized by mobility, adaptability, and a level of strategic sophistication that imperial commanders consistently underestimated. The Khan did not simply charge at imperial positions. He used feints, diversions, and rapid redeployment to isolate and destroy imperial forces in detail. Supply lines were targeted systematically. Fortifications were bypassed when possible and besieged only when necessary. The Khan understood that the empire\'s strength was its infrastructure and attacked that infrastructure relentlessly.\n\nBy Year 530, the Great Horde controlled territory stretching from the northern steppe to within two hundred leagues of the imperial capital. The Dominion had lost approximately a third of its territory and was facing genuine existential threat.\n\nTHE AFTERMATH\nThe Great Khan died in Year 534 -- natural causes, according to orc accounts; assassination, according to imperial claims; our intelligence is inconclusive. His three sons immediately fell into dispute over succession. The unified command structure fractured within months. The clans reverted to independent operation. The empire, given time to recover, gradually reclaimed its lost territory over the following century.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe Unification War demonstrates several critical lessons. First: orc military capability, when unified, exceeds imperial military capability. This is not opinion. It is the documented outcome of thirty years of warfare. Second: orc unity is fragile. It depends on exceptional leadership and collapses without it. Third: the empire\'s survival depended not on military superiority but on the orc succession crisis. Had the Khan lived another decade, or had his succession been orderly, the Holy Dominion might not exist today.\n\nFor the Council\'s purposes, the key variable remains orc unification. Our current assessment rates the probability of a new unification event within the next century at approximately fifteen percent. This may seem low. It is not low enough. The consequences of unification would be transformative -- potentially ending the empire\'s dominance and restructuring the entire continental balance of power.\n\nWe continue to monitor orc clan politics with this specific scenario in mind. Any signs of multi-clan consolidation beyond the current Iron Tusk-Stormborn alliance will trigger an elevated alert status.\n\nThe Great Khan proved what is possible. The clans remember. We must remember too.'

This is accurate as a mechanical\ndescription. It is wholly inadequate as an account of\nwhat the Rift actually is.\n\nI entered the Rift on fifteen separate occasions\nduring this survey period. I descended to floors\nbetween three and eleven on each entry. The following\nobservations are consistent across all fifteen visits.\n\nII. ON THE INHABITANTS\n\nThe entities that populate the Rift\'s floors are not\nmonsters in any conventional sense. They are not\nanimal. They are not elemental. They are not undead.\nThey wear the shapes of known species — orcish,\nelven, human, goblin — with a fidelity that is\ninitially convincing and immediately, profoundly wrong.\n\nThe wrongness is difficult to describe precisely. It\nbegins with the eyes. In every species, the eyes\nexpress something behind them — attention, hunger,\nfear, calculation. The eyes of the Rift\'s inhabitants\nexpress nothing. They are not vacant in the way a\ndead animal\'s eyes are vacant. They are active but\nempty, like light passing through a room where no one\nstands.\n\nThey do not speak. Guild lore records attempts by\nearly adventurers to communicate with them. In every\ndocumented case, the entity either attacked or stood\nmotionless. No response that could be interpreted as\ncommunication has ever been recorded.\n\nMost disturbingly: on three separate occasions, I\nobserved a Rift entity shift its apparent species\nwhile in motion. Not as a combat ability. Not with\nany visible trigger. One moment it appeared\nunmistakably orcish. The next, between one footfall\nand the next, it was lizardfolk. The third: human.\nThe motion did not pause. The entity did not appear\naware of the change. Whatever is inside these shapes,\nit does not identify with the shape it wears.\n\nIII. ON TIME AND CONTINUITY\n\nThe Rift does not experience time as we do. This is\nnot metaphor. Adventurers who have spent extended\nperiods on deep floors — floors twelve and beyond,\nwhich I was not authorized to reach in this survey —\nconsistently report that time felt wrong. Not slow.\nNot fast. Wrong in a way that resists description.\nDays felt like years. Then like moments. Then like\ndays again. The sun does not enter the Rift. There\nis no natural rhythm to orient by. There is only the\nfloors, and the things that wear familiar faces, and\nthe sounds they make that are almost but not quite\nthe sounds of living creatures.\n\nThe floor configuration reseeding at what appears\nto be a fixed interval from outside the Rift may not\ncorrespond to a fixed interval from inside it. I do\nnot have the mathematical framework to describe this\nmore precisely. Senior Warden Croft has assigned a\ntheoretical scholar to this question.\n\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe Rift is not a dungeon. It is a space that was\nnot built to be a dungeon and is serving that function\nbecause no adequate framework for what it actually\nis exists in Guild classification. Its inhabitants\nare not creatures. They are something that wears\ncreature-shapes without inhabiting them. Time\nbehaves differently inside it than outside.\n\nSomething has been in there for a very long time.\nLong enough to stop counting. Long enough to forget\nthat time was ever something measured in days and\nnot in the spaces between dying.\n\nI request authorization for deep-floor survey.\nSpecifically, I want to know what is on floor twenty-\nfive and beyond.\n\n                  - Sera Mosswick\n                    Year 463, Guild Research Division\n                    [Request denied.

This is\ncorrect. But it is incomplete. I must clarify what\nwas in Calidar before the Atlas came.\n\nThere were two distinct movements.\n\nTHE FIRST: THE VEL\'SHARATH\n\nAs I described in my confession, the Vel\'sharath were\nresearchers. Scholars. The name means Those Who Seek\nthe Light — and in this case, the light was quite\nliterally the gods they had discovered were absent.\nThey used the Lesser Lens to amplify divine resonance\nand measure what remained. They found almost nothing.\nThey concluded the gods had departed, not died. They\nwere trying to send a signal outward, beyond the\nboundaries of the known world, that might reach\nwherever the gods had gone.\n\nThey were elves of both lines — High and Dark alike.\nCael\'vorith himself was High Elven. Vel\'aneth, the\nSeer, was Dark. The movement did not fracture along\nthat division. It was united in purpose.\n\nTHEY WERE NOT TRYING TO HARM ANYONE.\n\nTHE SECOND: THE RECLAMATION SECT\n\nSeparate from the Vel\'sharath — and here the record\nmust be clear: entirely separate, sharing only a city\nand a general sense of grievance — was what I will\ncall the Reclamation Sect.\n\nThe Sect was Dark Elven exclusively. Younger members,\nmostly. They had watched the Dominion expand for\ngenerations. They had watched it sabotage divine\ncommunication between non-human races and their gods.\nThey had grown tired of patience. They began reaching\nout through ritual channels to their own gods,\nseeking not to find absent deities but to CALL those\ngods to intervene. To correct the human arrogance.\nTo impose a divine consequence on the Holy Dominion\'s\nceaseless expansion.\n\nThey were not subtle. The Dominion had been reading\ntheir signals for decades.\n\nTHE COLLISION\n\nThe Dominion used the Sect\'s activities as the\njustification for deploying the Atlas. This is\ndocumented in classified Imperial records I accessed\nbefore I went into hiding. The stated reason: the\nDark Elves were summoning divine power against the\nDominion. A threat to the natural order. A violation\nof the Helios Doctrine. An existential provocation.\n\nThis is technically true of the Sect. It is\ncategorically false of the Vel\'sharath.\n\nThe Atlas did not distinguish between them.\nThe Atlas destroyed everyone in Calidar.\nScholar and agitator alike. The innocent and the\nguilty and everyone in between.\n\nThis matters because the official Dominion history\ndefines what happened at Calidar as the destruction\nof a void cult that threatened reality. This is a\nlie built on a half-truth: there was a group in\nCalidar calling on dark divine powers for human\npunishment. They existed. What the official history\nomits is that they were a faction, not a civilization.\nNot the whole of elven culture. Not the Vel\'sharath,\nwho were the opposite of what the Dominion claims.\n\nThe empire destroyed a civilization to silence a\nfew dozen radical voices within it, and used those\nvoices as the excuse to silence everything else.\n\nI have lived five hundred years with the knowledge\nthat I could have spoken sooner. I choose to speak\nnow because someone reading the covenant fragments\ndeserves to understand what was actually in that\ncity before it burned.\n\n                  - Selendriel the Sorrowful\n                    Year 492.

Chosen\npersonally by the Prophet-King\'s court — not the\ncurrent Prophet-King, but his ancestor of Year -50\nwhose name the Dominion has quietly removed from\nofficial genealogies.

He activated\nit. His body and mind separated at the moment of\ndetonation — this is not metaphor; the divine energy\ndid something to his consciousness that tore it from\nhis physical self.\n\nA High Elven god held his soul above the burning\ncity and made him watch.\n\n[SOURCE 2: ASTRONOMY SECT SEALED TABLETS]\n\nThe Dark Elven god\'s punishment was specific. Detailed.\nCalibrated for the individual.\n\nA spatial rift had torn open at the Atlas\'s epicenter\nas a consequence of the divine energy released. The\ngod placed a new artifact inside the soldier\'s chest —\nnot the Atlas, which was spent and destroyed, but\nsomething smaller and darker and designed not to\ndestroy but to bind. The god spoke to him. The exact\nwords are not recorded; the Astronomy Sect works from\nresidual energy signatures, not transcription. But\nthe instruction is clear:\n\nFive souls were trapped within the Rift.\nFive souls caused by his actions.\nFive souls must be retrieved.\n\nThe soldier entered the Rift.\n\n[SOURCE 3: HIGH ELVEN THEOLOGICAL EXILE RECORDS]\n\nWhat happens inside the Rift is known only in\nfragments, reconstructed from High Elven religious\nscholars who preserved Dark Elven theological texts\nin secret after Year 0 — specifically records\ndescribing the Dark Elven god\'s known methods of\ndivine punishment — cross-referenced with Adventure\nGuild field observations of the soldier\'s behavior\ninside the Rift. We present the synthesis.\n\nThe Rift is vast. Each floor is different. The things\nthat walk inside it are not alive — they wear living\nforms but are hollow behind the eyes. Time moves\ndifferently inside: a day outside can be a decade\nwithin. Years within the Rift can pass in an hour\nof surface time.\n\nHe fought through them. He died on those floors —\nthe artifact in his chest would not allow permanent\ndeath — and his position reset. He fought through\nagain. Twenty-five floors before the first divine\nsoul: a High Elven deity, trapped and struggling and\nfighting him across resets and deaths and decades of\nsubjective time. He prevailed. He trapped the soul\nin the artifact the Dark Elven god had given him.\n\nFive times this happened. Five divine souls captured\nacross what felt to him like lifetimes.\n\nWhen the fifth was secured, he called for the Dark\nElven god. He asked for peace. He believed he had\nearned it.\n\nThe god came. And laughed. And plucked the souls\nfrom the device. And left fragments of those five\ndivine essences — one in each limb, one in his\nhead, stitched into him like anchors — scattered\nthroughout his body where they could not be removed.\nHe is not a lich by choice or by the conventional\ndark arts. He is a man with pieces of gods inside\nhim, unable to die, unable to leave, unable to be\nwhat he was.\n\nThe Dark Elven god called this mercy. The Dark Elven\ngod moved the Rift and the soldier within it to the\nheart of the old human capital as a monument and a\nwarning. And departed.\n\n[RESEARCH DIVISION ASSESSMENT]\n\nHe has been inside the Rift for five hundred years.\nHe wants out. He is sending pieces of himself\noutward — the divine fragments allowing him to push\nsliver-selves through tears in the fabric — and\nusing those slivers to create strongholds, raise\nnecromancers, and widen the Rift from the outside.\n\nHe is looking for Helios. He served Helios. He\nbelieves Helios can free him. He does not know that\nHelios is sealed below the capital, barely alive,\ndrained of essence for five centuries. Helios cannot\nreach anyone. Helios cannot answer.\n\nThis is not a monster.\n\nThis is a man who was told to do something righteous,\ndid it, and has been paying for it ever since.

Millions died, but reality was saved.\n\nThis is the story taught in every school, preached\nin every temple, recorded in every imperial archive.\n\nEvery word of it is a lie.\n\n===============================================\n\nWHAT THE VEL\'SHARATH ACTUALLY WERE\n\nThe name "Vel\'sharath" translates from Old Elvish as\n"Those Who Seek the Light." The imperial translation\n("Void Covenant" or "Hollow Circle") is a\ndeliberate fabrication, part of the cover story\nconstructed after Calidar\'s destruction.\n\nThe Vel\'sharath were an elven scholarly order:\npriests, researchers, mystics, and theologians.\nFounded by Cael\'vorith the Seeker approximately six\ncenturies before present day, they began as devout\nseekers, driven not by doubt but by longing. They\nwanted to reach the gods. To commune with the divine\ndirectly. To hear the voice behind the silence of\nprayer.\n\nThey studied divine resonance for two centuries,\nmeasuring prayer responses across seventeen temples,\ntracking fluctuations in divine healing, mapping the\nsacred sites. They were not looking for absence --\nthey were looking for presence. A way through.\n\nThen they uncovered the Lesser Lens in ruins beneath\nMount Ilvareth, a divine artifact of non-mortal\norigin. When they activated it, seeking the gods,\nthe truth hit them like a hammer:\n\nTHE GODS ARE MISSING.\n\nNot dead. Not sleeping. Not testing the faithful.\nGONE. The Vel\'sharath had gone searching for the\ndivine and found only its absence. The thrones of\nheaven sit empty. The prayers of billions rise into\nsilence.\n\nThey had not set out to prove the gods were gone.\nThey set out to find them. And found nothing.\n\n===============================================\n\nWHAT THEY DISCOVERED ABOUT HELIOS\n\nHelios, the Sun God, foundation of the Holy\nDominion\'s theological authority, is not a true god.\n\nHe is a demi-god. A lesser divine being, powerful\nbut not omnipotent. And he is not enthroned in heaven\nblessing the faithful.\n\nHe is IMPRISONED beneath the Holy City.\n\nChained in the foundations of the Grand Cathedral,\nHelios has been drained for centuries. His divine\nessence is siphoned to fuel the empire\'s holy magic,\nto power its priests, to sustain the illusion of\ndivine mandate. The prayers that rise from a billion\nthroats reach a being who cannot answer, not\nbecause he chooses silence, but because he is in\nchains.\n\nThe entire theological foundation of the Holy\nDominion is built on the suffering of a captive\ndemi-god.\n\n===============================================\n\nWHAT THEY DISCOVERED ABOUT HEAVEN\'S ATLAS\n\nHeaven\'s Atlas was not built by mortal hands. It is\na divine artifact, a tool created by the true gods\nbefore their departure. Its original purpose was\ncartographic: mapping the architecture of reality\nitself, charting space, time, and the boundaries\nbetween worlds.\n\nIn the hands of its makers, it was an instrument of\nunderstanding. In the hands of mortals who do not\ncomprehend its true nature, it is a weapon of\nannihilation capable of erasing civilizations.\n\nThe empire did not create Heaven\'s Atlas. They found\nit. Or stole it.\n\n===============================================\n\nTHE LESSER LENS\n\nThe Vel\'sharath uncovered, in sealed ruins beneath\nMount Ilvareth, a smaller artifact operating on the\nsame divine principles as Heaven\'s Atlas. They called\nit the Lesser Lens.\n\nWhere Heaven\'s Atlas maps reality, the Lesser Lens\nfocuses spiritual resonance. It amplifies prayer,\nconcentrating the combined devotion of dozens of\npractitioners into a signal powerful enough to reach\nacross distances that ordinary prayer cannot cross.\n\nThe Vel\'sharath were using the Lesser Lens to do\nwhat no one had attempted in recorded history:\n\nCALL THE GODS HOME.\n\nTheir ritual, the Rite of Reaching, was not an\ninvocation of darkness. It was a prayer so\nconcentrated, so desperate, so pure that it could\ncross the gulf between worlds.\n\nThey were trying to save everything.\n\n===============================================\n\nWHY THE EMPIRE DESTROYED CALIDAR\n\nWhen the Holy Dominion discovered what the Vel\'sharath\nwere doing, they recognized the threat immediately.\nBut the threat was not cosmic. It was POLITICAL.\n\nIf the Vel\'sharath contacted the gods, or even\npublished their findings:\n\n- The truth about Helios would be exposed. A chained,\n  suffering demi-god does not grant divine mandates.\n- The nature of Heaven\'s Atlas would be revealed. The\n  empire\'s ultimate weapon is a stolen god-tool.\n- The absence of the true gods would become known.\n  Every prayer has been directed at empty thrones.\n\nThe Vel\'sharath\'s research threatened to unravel\nEVERYTHING the Holy Dominion was built on.\n\nSo the empire activated Heaven\'s Atlas.\n\nThe activation drained ninety-five percent of Helios\'s\nremaining life force. The captive demi-god was nearly\nkilled to fuel the weapon that destroyed the people\ntrying to free him.\n\nCalidar was obliterated. Every elf, every record,\nevery piece of the Vel\'sharath\'s research, the Lesser\nLens, the proof... all of it turned to glass and ash.\n\nThen the empire wrote the history:\n\n"A dangerous cult was opening a gate to the Void that\nwould have destroyed reality. We saved the world."\n\nAnd the world believed them.\n\n===============================================\n\nTHE WITNESSES\n\nA soldier named Aldous Kern saw the truth. He\ntestified that the Vel\'sharath were praying, not\nsummoning darkness. He died in imperial custody.\nNatural causes, they said.\n\nAn elf named Selendriel knew the truth. She had\nstudied alongside Cael\'vorith. She said nothing for\nfive hundred years. She carved her confession in\nstone because paper burns and empires rewrite what\nthey please.\n\nA researcher named Venatrix Coldwell found the truth.\nShe confirmed: no void energy at the site. Only\namplified prayer directed outward, toward absent gods.\nShe hid her findings and disappeared.\n\nThe empire silenced them all. But stone endures. And\nglass preserves what fire cannot destroy.\n\n===============================================\n\nTHE QUESTIONS THAT REMAIN\n\nWHERE DID THE GODS GO?\nThe thrones of heaven are empty. The true gods\ndeparted in an age beyond memory. Why? The\nVel\'sharath traced faint paths leading outward,\nbeyond the edges of reality. The gods went SOMEWHERE.\nNo one has followed.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS TO HELIOS?\nThe captive demi-god has been drained for centuries.\nThe activation of Heaven\'s Atlas consumed nearly all\nof his remaining essence. Is he still alive? What\nhappens when his light goes out?\n\nWHAT IS HEAVEN\'S ATLAS, TRULY?\nA divine cartographic instrument stolen by mortals\nand used as a weapon. What would it reveal if used\nas the gods intended? Could it find them?\n\nWHAT DID THE VEL\'SHARATH ALMOST REACH?\nIn their final moments, the Vel\'sharath sent their\nsignal outward. Did anything receive it? Did something\nhear the call before the fire came?\n\nAnd if so... is something coming back?\n\n===============================================\n\nThe empire built its order on a foundation of lies:\na captive god, a stolen weapon, and the ashes of\nthose who dared to seek the truth.\n\nBut truth does not burn. It vitrifies. It is\npreserved in glass, in stone, in the memories of\nthose old enough to remember.\n\nThe Vel\'sharath, Those Who Seek the Light, are\ngone. Their order is ash. Their homeland is glass.\n\nBut their question echoes still, in the silence\nbetween prayers, in the emptiness above the altars:\n\nWhere are the gods?\n\nAnd what becomes of us, alone in a world they\nabandoned, ruled by those who profit from their\nabsence?\n\n===============================================\n\nRemember the Vel\'sharath.\nRemember what they sought.\nRemember what was done to silence them.\n\nAnd if you have the courage they had --\n\nLook up.\n\nThe heavens are empty.\nBut perhaps not forever.'
